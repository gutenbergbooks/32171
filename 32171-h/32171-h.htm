Safety, upon the Account of the <i>Sickness</i> now in <i>France</i>, that proper

<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>THE PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps"><i>This</i></span> <i>Book having at first been written only as a Plan of Directions for
preserving our Country from the</i> Plague<span class="foot"><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></span> <i>was then very short and
concise. An Act of Parliament being immediately after made for
performing</i> Quarantaines <i>&amp;c. according to the Rules here laid down, it
passed through seven Editions in one year without any Alterations. I
then thought proper to make some</i> Additions <i>to it, in order to shew the
Reasonableness of the Methods prescribed, by giving a more full
Description <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>of this Disease, and collecting some Examples of the good
Success which had attended such Measures, when they had been put in
Practice. At the same time I annex&#8217;d a short Chapter relating to the
Cure of the Plague; being induced thereto by considering how widely most
Authors have erred in prescribing a Heap of useless and very often
hurtful Medicines, which they recommend under the specious Titles of</i>
Antidotes, Specifics <i>and</i> Alexipharmacs: <i>hoping that the great
Resemblance, which I had observed between this Disease and the</i> Small
Pox, <i>would justify my writing upon a Distemper which I have never
seen.</i></p>

<p><i>INDEED the</i> Small Pox <i>is a true</i> Plague, <i>tho&#8217; of a particular kind,
bred, as I have shewn all Pestilences are, in the same hot</i> Egyptian
<i>Climate, and brought into</i> Asia <i>and</i> Europe <i>by the way of Commerce;
but most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> remarkably by the War with the</i> Saracens, <i>called the</i> Holy
War, <i>at the latter end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth
Century<span class="foot"><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></span>. Ever since which time the morbific Seeds of it have been
preserved in the infected Cloaths and the Furniture of Houses: and have
broken out more or less in all Countries, according as the hot and moist
Temperature of the Air has favoured their Spreading and the Exertion of
their Force. The</i> Measles <i>is likewise a</i> Plague sui generis, <i>and owes
its Origin to the same Country.</i></p>

<p><i>I have now revised my little Work once more: and though I cannot find
any reason to change my Mind as to any material Points which regard
either the</i> Preventing <i>or the</i> Stopping <i>the Progress of</i> Infection;
<i>yet I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> here and there added some new</i> Strokes <i>of Reasoning, and,
as the Painters say, retouch&#8217;d the</i> Ornaments, <i>and hightened the</i>
Colouring <i>of the</i> Piece.</p>

<p><i>THE Substance of the long Preface to the last Edition is as follows.</i></p>

<p><i>I have insisted more at large upon the</i> Infection <i>of this Disease,
than I could ever have thought needful at this time, after</i> Europe <i>has
had Experience of the Distemper for so many Ages; had I not been
surprized by the late Attempts of some Physicians in</i> France <i>to prove
the contrary, even while they have the most undeniable Arguments against
them before their Eyes. In particular, I cannot but very much admire to
see Dr.</i> Chicoyneau, <i>and the other Physicians, who first gave us</i>
Observations <i>on the</i> Plague, <i>when at</i> Marseilles, <i>relate in the</i>
Reflections, <i>they afterwards published upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> those Observations, the
Case of a Man, who was seized with the</i> Plague, <i>upon his burying a
young Woman dead of it, when no one else dared to approach the Body; and
yet to see them ascribe his Disease, not to his being</i> infected <i>by the
Woman, but solely to his Grief for the Loss of her, to whom he had made
Love, and to a</i> Diarrh&oelig;a, <i>which had been some time upon him<span class="foot"><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></span>. No
question but these concurred to make his Disease the more violent; and
perhaps even exposed him to contract the</i> Infection: <i>but why it should
be supposed, that he was not</i> infected, <i>I cannot imagine, when there
was so plain an Appearance of it. I am as much at a Loss to find any
Colour of Reason for their denying</i> Infection <i>in another Case, they
relate, of a</i> young <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>Lady <i>seized with the</i> Plague, <i>upon the sudden
Sight of a</i> <span class="smcap">Pestilential Tumor</span>, <i>just broke out upon her Maid; not
allowing any thing but the Lady&#8217;s Surprize to be the Cause of her
Illness</i><span class="foot"><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>THE Truth is, these Physicians had engaged themselves in an</i>
Hypothesis, <i>that the</i> Plague <i>was bred at</i> Marseilles <i>by a long Use of
bad Aliment, and grew so fond of their Opinion, as not to be moved by
the most convincing Evidence. And thus it mostly happens, when we
indulge Conjectures instead of pursuing the true Course for making
Discoveries in Nature.</i></p>

<p><i>I KNOW they imagine this their Sentiment to be abundantly confirmed
from some Experiments made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> Dr.</i>
Deidier<span class="foot"><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></span> <i>upon the</i> Bile <i>taken
from Persons dead of the</i> Plague: <i>which having been either poured into
a Wound made on purpose in different</i> Dogs, <i>or injected into their
Veins, never failed, in many Trials, to produce in them all the Symptoms
of the Pestilence, even the external ones of</i> Bubo&#8217;s <i>and</i> Carbuncles.
<i>One Dog, upon which the Experiment succeeded, had been known, for three
Months before, to devour greedily the corrupted</i> Flesh <i>of infected
Persons, and</i> Pledgets <i>taken off from</i> Pestilential Ulcers, <i>without
receiving any Injury. From hence they conclude<span class="foot"><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></span> that this Disease is
not communicated by</i> Contagion, <i>but originally bred in the Body by the
Corruption of the</i> Bile. <i>This Corruption, they say, is the Effect of
unwholsome Food; and the</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>Bile <i>thus corrupted produces a Thickness and
a Degree of Coagulation in the Blood, which is the Cause of the</i> Plague:
<i>Tho&#8217; this they allow to be inforced by a bad Season of the Year, and
the</i> Terrors <i>of Mind and Despair of the Inhabitants.</i></p>

<p><i>THESE Experiments are indeed curious, but fall very short of what they
are brought to prove. The most that can be gathered from them is this:
That</i> Dogs <i>do not, at least not so readily, receive</i> Pestilential
Infection <i>from Men, as Men do from one another: And also, that the</i>
Bile <i>is so highly corrupted in a Body infected with the</i> Plague, <i>that
by putting it into the Blood of a</i> Dog <i>it will immediately breed the
same Disease.</i></p>

<p><i>BUT it does not follow from hence, that the</i> Bile <i>is the Seat of the
Disease, or that other Humors of the Body are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> not corrupted as well as</i>
this. <i>I make no question but the whole Mass of Blood is, in this Case,
in a State of Putrefaction; and consequently that all the Liquors
derived from it partake of the Taint.</i></p>

<p><i>ACCORDINGLY it appeared afterwards from some Experiments made by Dr.</i>
Couzier<span class="foot"><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></span>, <i>that not only the</i> Blood, <i>but even the</i> Urine <i>from an
infected person, infused into the crural Vein of a Dog communicated the</i>
Plague. <i>I will venture to affirm, that if, instead of</i> Bile, Blood,
<i>or</i> Urine, <i>the</i> Matter <i>of the</i> Ulcers <i>had been put into a Wound made
in the Dog; it would have had at least an equally pernicious Effect: As
may well be concluded from the Inoculation of the Small Pox.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span><i>AS to the Dog&#8217;s eating the</i> corrupted Flesh <i>and</i> purulent Matter <i>of
the Patients; it ought to have been considered that there are some
Poisons very powerful when mixed immediately with the Blood, which will
not operate in the Stomach at all: As in particular the</i> Saliva <i>of the
mad Dog and the</i> Venom <i>of the Viper<span class="foot"><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></span>. And therefore Dr.</i> Deidier
<i>himself, some Months after his former Experiments, found that</i>
pestiferous Bile <i>itself was swallowed by Dogs without any Harm<span class="foot"><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></span>.</i></p>

<p><i>THE right Inference to be made from these Experiments, I think, would
have been this: That since the Blood and all the Humors are so greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>corrupted in the Plague, as that Dogs (tho&#8217; not so liable to catch the
Distemper in the ordinary way of Infection, as Men are) may receive it
by a small Quantity of any of these from a diseased Subject being mixed
with their Blood; it may well be supposed, that the</i> Effluvia <i>from an
infected Person, drawn into the Body of one who is sound, may be
pestiferous and productive of the like Disorder.</i></p>

<p><i>MY Assertion, that these</i> French <i>Physicians have before them the
fullest Proofs of this</i> Infection, <i>not only appears from these
Instances of it, I have observed to be recorded by themselves; but
likewise from what Dr.</i> le Moine <i>and Dr.</i> Bailly<span class="foot"><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></span> <i>have written, of
the Manner in which the</i> Plague <i>was brought to</i> Canourgue <i>in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> the</i>
Gevaudan: <i>as also from an amazing Instance they give us of the great
Subtilty of this</i> Poison, <i>experienced at</i> Marvejols: <i>where no less
than</i> sixty <i>Persons were at once infected in a</i> Church, <i>by one that
came thither out of an infected House. The</i> Plague <i>was carried from</i>
Marseilles <i>to</i> Canourgue, <i>as follows. A</i> Gally-Slave, <i>employed in
burying the Dead at</i> Marseilles, <i>escaped from thence to the Village of</i>
St. Laurent de Rivedolt, <i>a League distant from</i> Correjac: <i>where
finding a Kinsman, who belonged to the latter Place, he presented him
with a</i> Waistcoat <i>and a</i> pair of Stockings <i>he had brought along with
him. The</i> Kinsman <i>returns to his Village, and dies in two or three
Days; being followed soon after by</i> three Children <i>and their</i> Mother.
<i>His</i> Son, <i>who lived at</i> Canourgue, <i>went from thence, in order to bury
the Family; and, at his Return, gave to his</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> Brother-in-law <i>a</i> Cloak
<i>he had brought with him: the</i> Brother-in-law <i>laying it upon his Bed,
lost a little</i> Child <i>which lay with him, in one Day&#8217;s Time; and two
Days after, his Wife;</i> himself <i>following in seven or eight. The</i>
Parents <i>of this unhappy Family, taking Possession of the</i> Goods <i>of the
Deceased, underwent the same Fate.</i></p>

<p><i>ALL this abundantly shews how inexcusable the foresaid Physicians in</i>
France <i>are, in their opposing the common Opinion that the</i> Plague <i>is
contagious. However, I have paid so much Regard to them, as to insist
the more largely upon the Proof of that</i> Contagion; <i>lest the Opinion of
those, who have had so much Experience of the Disease, might lead any
one into an Error, in an Affair of such Consequence, that all my
Precepts relating to</i> Quarantaines, <i>and well nigh every particular Part
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> my Advice, depends upon it: For if this Opinion were a Mistake,</i>
Quarantaines, <i>and all the like</i> Means of Defence, <i>ought to be thrown
aside as of no use. But as I continue persuaded, that we have the
greatest Evidence, that the</i> <span class="smcap"><span class="gesp">Plague</span></span> <i>is a</i> contagious <i>Disease; so I
have left, without any Alteration, all my Directions in respect to</i>
Quarantaines: <i>in which, I hope, I have not recommended any Thing</i>
prejudicial to Trade; <i>my Advice being very little different from what
has been long practised in all the</i> trading <i>Ports of</i> Italy, <i>and in
other Places. Nay, were we to be more remiss in this than our
Neighbours, I cannot think but the</i> Fear <i>they would have of us, must
much obstruct our</i> Commerce.</p>

<p><i>BUT I shall pursue this Point no farther: the rather because a very
learned Physician among themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> has since, both by strong Reasoning
and undeniable Instances, evinced the Reality of</i> Contagion<span class="foot"><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>IN a word, the more I consider this Matter, the more I am convinced
that the Precepts I have delivered, both with regard to the Preventing
the Plague from coming into a Country, and the Treatment of it when
present, are perfectly suitable to the Nature of the Distemper, and
consequently the fittest to be complied with. But how far, in every
Situation of Affairs, it is expedient to grant the</i> Powers, <i>requisite
for putting all of them in Practice, it is not my proper Business, as a
Physician, to determine. No doubt, but at all Times, these</i> Powers
<i>ought to be so limited and restrained, that they may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>never endanger
the Rights and Liberties of a People. Indeed, as I have had no other
View than the Publick Good in this my Undertaking, and the Satisfaction
of doing somewhat towards the Relief of Mankind, under the greatest of
Calamities; so I should not, without the utmost Concern, see that any
Thing of mine gave the least Countenance to Cruelty and Oppression.</i></p>

<p><i>BUT I must confess, I find no Reason for any Apprehensions of this
kind, from any thing I have advanced. For what extraordinary Danger can
there be, in lodging</i> Powers <i>for the proper Management of People under
the Plague, with a</i> Council of Health, <i>or other Magistrates, who shall
be accountable, like all other Civil Officers, for their just Behaviour
in the Execution of them? Though this I must leave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> those, who are
better skilled in the Nature of Government. But sure I am, that by the
Rules here given, both the</i> Sick <i>will be provided for with more
Humanity, and the Country more effectually defended against the Progress
of the Disease, than by any of the Methods heretofore generally put in
Practice, either in our own, or in other Nations.</i></p>

<p><i>THE Usage among</i> Us, <i>established by</i> Act of Parliament, <i>of</i>
Imprisoning <i>in their Houses every Family the</i> Plague <i>seizes on,
without allowing any one to pass in or out, but such as are appointed by
Authority, to perform the necessary Offices about the Sick, is certainly
the severest Treatment imaginable; as it exposes the whole Family to
suffer by the same Disease; and consequently is little less than
assigning them over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> the cruellest of Deaths: As I have shewn in the
Discourse.</i></p>

<p><i>THE Methods practised in</i> France <i>are likewise obnoxious to great
Objections.</i> Crowding <i>the Sick together in</i> Hospitals <i>can serve to no
good Purpose; but instead thereof will</i> promote <i>and</i> spread <i>the</i>
Contagion, <i>and besides will expose the Sick to the greatest Hardships.
It is no small Part of the Misery, that attends this terrible Enemy of
Mankind, that whereas moderate Calamities open the Hearts of Men to</i>
Compassion <i>and</i> Tenderness, <i>this greatest of Evils is found to have
the contrary Effect. Whether Men of wicked Minds, through Hopes of
Impunity, at these Times of Disorder and Confusion, give their evil
Disposition full Scope, which ordinarily is restrained by the Fear of
Punishment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> or whether it be, that a constant View of Calamities and
Distress does so pervert the Minds of Men, as to blot out all Sentiments
of Humanity; or whatever else be the Cause: certain it is, that at such
Times, when it should be expected to see all Men unite in one common
Endeavour, to moderate the publick Misery; quite otherwise, they grow
regardless of each other, and Barbarities are often practised, unknown
at other Times. Accordingly</i> Diemerbroek <i>informs us, that he himself
had often seen these</i> Hospitals <i>committed to the Charge of Villains,
whose Inhumanity has suffered great Numbers to perish by Neglect, and
that sometimes they have even smothered such as have been very weak, or
have had nauseous Ulcers difficult to cure. Insomuch, that in many
Places the Sick have chose to lay themselves in Fields, in the open
Air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> under the slightest Coverings, rather than to fall into the
barbarous Hands of those who have had the Management of these
Hospitals<span class="foot"><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></span>.</i></p>

<p><i>THE rigorous Restraints observed at their</i> Lines, <i>are attended also
with the like Inconveniences. For by absolutely denying a Passage to
People from</i> infected <i>Places, they subject to the same common Ruin,
both from the Disease, and from the Disorders committed in such Places,
those, whom their Fortunes would otherwise furnish with Means of
escaping: and this, no doubt, in every free Country, must be looked upon
as an unjust</i> Infringement of Liberty, <i>and a Diminution of Mens natural
Rights, not to be allowed.</i></p>

<p><i>NOW, under all these Difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> I cannot but with the greatest
Satisfaction observe, that my</i> Precepts <i>are well nigh, nay altogether
free from them; and yet a proper Regard is had to the Disease. As soon
as ever the</i> Sick <i>are grown numerous, I advise, that they be left in
their Houses, without any of those unmerciful Restraints heretofore put
upon them and the Families they belonged to. I might, perhaps, have
justly directed, that whenever those, who frequent or dwell in an</i>
infected <i>House, go abroad, they should be obliged to carry about them</i>
a long Stick <i>of some remarkable Colour, or other</i> visible Token, <i>by
which People may be warned from holding too free Converse with them:
this being the Practice on these Occasions, as I have heard, in some
Places. The</i> Removal of the Sick <i>from their Houses, I advise only at
the beginning, when it will be attended with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> none of the forementioned
Inconveniences: but is what, for the most Part, those Sick should
themselves desire. It has hardly ever been known, when the Disease did
not first begin among the</i> Poor. <i>Such therefore only will be subject to
this Regulation, whose Habitations by the Closeness of them are in all
Respects very incommodious for diseased Persons. So that my Advice
chiefly amounts to the giving Relief to the</i> Poor, <i>who shall first be</i>
infected, <i>by removing them into more convenient Lodgings than their
own, where they shall be better provided for than at home. And the</i>
Removal <i>of them will not be attended with that Danger, it is natural
for the Unskilful to apprehend in so dreadful a Disease; because it is
every Day practised in the</i> Small-Pox, <i>with great Safety. And whereas I
have before observed, that People have often suffered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> publick</i>
Hospitals <i>by the Inhumanity of their Attendants; in this Case, little
or nothing of that kind is to be feared: for I have proposed this</i>
Removal <i>of the</i> Sick <i>only, at a Time, when a long</i> Series <i>of</i>
Calamities <i>has not yet bred Disorders and Hardness of Heart. Nay, it
may be reasonably expected that they should rather be used with the
tenderest Care, when every one shall believe the Stopping of the
Distemper, and consequently their own Safety to depend upon it. And as
this Treatment will be both safe and beneficial to the</i> Sick, <i>so it
will be much more evidently for the Advantage of the sound Part of the
Family, and of those who live near them. For as the</i> poorer <i>Sort of
People subsist by their daily Labour, no sooner shall the</i> Plague <i>have
broke out among them, but the sick Families, and all their Neighbours
likewise, if not relieved by the Publick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> shall be abandoned to perish
by</i> Want, <i>unless the Progress of the Distemper put a shorter Period to
their Lives.</i></p>

<p><i>THIS Observation, that the</i> Plague <i>usually begins among the</i> Poor,
<i>was the Reason, why I did not make any Difference in my Directions for</i>
removing the Sick, <i>in regard to their different Fortunes, when I first
gave my Thoughts upon this Subject: which however, to prevent Cavils, I
have at present done; and have shewn what Method ought to be taken, if
by some unusual Chance, the</i> Plague <i>should at the beginning enter a
wealthy Family. And, in this Case, I have advised nothing, which I would
not most readily submit to my self: For I should much rather chuse to be
thus removed from my Dwelling, with the Distemper upon me, to save my
Family, than they, by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> shut up with me, should be all exposed to
perish. And as this Way of treating diseased Families is the most
compassionate, that can be devised with any regard to the restraining
the Progress of the Distemper; so it is still much preferable to what
was formerly practised amongst us, on other Accounts. For, according to
what I have advised, it is only required, to</i> remove some few <i>Families
at the beginning of the Disease: whereas the Method of</i> shutting up
<i>Houses was continued through the whole Course of the Sickness. Perhaps
the Plague, under this Management, may not reach half a Score Families:
I have given Instances, where it has thus been stopt in</i> One.</p>

<p><i>WHAT relates to the inclosing</i> Infected <i>Places with</i> Lines, <i>I have so
regulated, that no body can be subjected to any Degree of Hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
thereby: for I have provided, that free Liberty be given to every one,
that pleases, to depart from the</i> Infected <i>Place, without being put to
any other Difficulty, than the Performance of a short</i> Quarantaine <i>of
about three Weeks, in some Place of Safety. So that no one shall be
compelled to continue in the infected Town, whom his own Circumstances
will not confine.</i></p>

<p><i>THIS part of my Directions is not so</i> general <i>as the rest, because
some Places are too great to admit of it: which occasioned my proposing
it with a Restriction<span class="foot"><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></span>. But as this is a great Inconvenience to the
rest of the</i> Country, <i>so it is far from being any Advantage to the</i>
Place <i>thus left unguarded. For when all, who leave an</i> infected <i>Place,
carry with them</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> Certificates <i>of their having submitted to such</i>
Quarantaine, <i>as may remove all Cause of Suspicion,</i> Travelling <i>will be
much more safe and commodious, than otherwise it can be. For want of
this, when the</i> Plague <i>was last at</i> London, <i>it was difficult to
withdraw from it, while the</i> Country <i>was every where afraid of</i>
Strangers, <i>and the</i> Inns <i>on the</i> Roads <i>were unsafe to lodge in for
those, who travelled from the</i> City; <i>when it could not be known, but</i>
Infection <i>might be received in them by others come from the same
Place.</i></p>

<p><i>AND from hence it happened that the</i> Plague, <i>when last in</i> England,
<i>though much more moderate, and though it continued not above one Year
in the City of</i> London, <i>did yet spread it self over a great Part of</i>
England, <i>getting into</i> Kent, <i>even as far as</i> Dover; <i>into</i> Sussex,
Hampshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> Dorsetshire, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire,
Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, <i>and, to mention no more, as
far as</i> Newcastle<span class="foot"><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>THUS, as I have examined through the Course of the following</i> Treatise,
<i>with all possible Care, into the Agreement of my</i> Precepts <i>with the
Nature of the</i> Plague; <i>so I have now considered how far they can
conveniently be put in Practice.</i></p>

<p><i>BUT it is time to have done with a Subject by no means agreeable.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall therefore conclude all I have to say upon this Matter, with a</i>
Paper <i>well deserving Perusal, which is come to my Hands, since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>following Sheets were finished; and therefore too late to be made use
of in its proper Place: for which Reason, I shall give it here entire.
This</i> Paper <i>contains the Methods taken by his late</i> Majesty, <i>when the</i>
Plague <i>in the Year</i> 1712. <i>had entered his</i> Dominions <i>in</i> Germany. <i>It
was delivered to me from Mr.</i> Backmeister, <i>the Secretary at</i> Hanover
<i>to his</i> Majesty <i>for the</i> German <i>Affairs, who was the Person, that
issued out the</i> Orders <i>that were given. This</i> Relation <i>I requested
from the Secretary, being desirous to know how far the</i> Measures <i>then
taken, agreed with my</i> Directions: <i>because I had been informed, that
they were very successful. And I have the Satisfaction to find them very
conformable to my</i> Precepts; <i>and that they had so much the desired
Effect, as to stop the</i> Plague <i>from spreading beyond the small Number
of</i> Towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span> <i>and</i> Villages <i>recited at the beginning of the</i> Paper.</p>

<p><i>IN the last</i> Place, <i>three labouring Men, who had made their Escape
from</i> Hamburgh, <i>got into a Barn in the Night, and were found dead there
the next Morning, with Marks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> Plague upon them: but the Progress
of the Infection was stopt by burning the Barn.</i></p>

<p><i>AS soon as any Village was infected, the first Thing done was to make
a</i> Line <i>round it, thereby to hinder the Inhabitants from communicating
with others. Those who were thus shut up, were immediately furnished
with Provisions: a Physician was sent to them; and especially some
Surgeons; a Minister to officiate particularly to Persons infected; a
Nurse; Buriers;</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>THE principal Management of this whole Affair consisted in two Things:</i>
1. <i>In</i> separating <i>the Sick from the Sound; and</i> 2. <i>In</i> cleaning <i>well
the Houses which had been infected.</i></p>

<p><i>WHEN any Person was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> ill, he was obliged to leave his Lodging,
and retire into a</i> Lazaretto <i>or</i> Hospital, <i>built for that Purpose. The
other Persons, who appeared to be well in the same House, were obliged,
when it was practicable, to strip themselves in the Night quite naked,
to put on other Clothes, which were provided for them, and to go to
perform</i> Quarantaine <i>in a House appointed for it, after having burnt
the Clothes, they had put off. Persons were made to change their
Clothes, and those they put off were burnt, as often as was judged
necessary: For Example, this was done when those who had recovered their
Health, came out of the</i> Lazaretto <i>and went into</i> Quarantaine; <i>and
likewise, when (after the Disease was ceased) the Women who attended the
Sick, the Buriers, and Surgeons, went into</i> Quarantaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span><i>IN Summer, ordinary</i> Barracks <i>(or Huts) were made for those of the
common People, who were obliged to quit infected Houses: which Barracks
were afterwards burnt, when they had been made Use of.</i></p>

<p><i>AS soon as the People were come out of an infected House, it was nailed
up, and Centinels were posted there, that nothing might be stolen out of
it. In the Country, when such a House was not of very great Value, and
it might be done without Danger, it was</i> burnt, <i>and the Loss was made
good to the Owner, at the Expence of the Publick. But in Towns, where
this could not be done, without the Hazard of burning the Town, Men were
hired to go into the Houses, and bring into the Court-Yard, or before
the House, whatever Goods they found in it susceptible of Contagion, and
there</i> burn <i>them: but to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> the Fright which this might raise
among the Neighbours, such Goods were sometimes put into the Cart, used
to carry off dead Bodies, and so conveyed out of the Town and burnt. At
first, the Method taken, was only to</i> bury <i>such Goods deep in the
Ground: but it was found by several Examples, that they were dug up
again, and that the Infection was thereby renewed. Before People were
paid for their Houses and Effects, that were burnt, it was discovered,
that they often laid some of their Goods out of the Way, and that the
Contagion was spread by them: but after they came to be paid what was
reasonable, by the Publick, they willingly let all be burnt, without
concealing any thing.</i></p>

<p><i>IN Summer, the Cattle were left abroad, and the Inhabitants, who had
not the Plague in their Houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> were obliged to look after them: In
Winter, the Sound Persons were obliged, before they left an infected
House, to kill the Cattle belonging to it, and to bury them ten Foot
deep in the Ground near the House.</i></p>

<p><i>So far the former Preface.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap">I <i>think it now proper to take Notice, that an</i> Act of Parliament <i>(as
above mentioned in this Preface) formed upon the Precepts here
delivered, having been passed on</i> December 8, 1720. <i>the two last</i>
Clauses <i>in the said Act, relating to the</i> removing <i>of Sick Persons
from their Habitations, and the making of</i> Lines <i>about Places infected,
were on</i> October 19 <i>of the following Year, repealed.</i></p>

<p><i>THIS looks as if the Rules prescribed were not right and just: I must
therefore observe, in Justification of myself, that this was not the
Case. Nothing was urged in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span> Repeal against the Reasonableness of
the Directions in themselves, more than in these Words:</i> That the
Execution of them might be very grievous to the Subjects of this
Kingdom. <i>But this I have proved to be quite otherwise.</i></p>

<p><i>THE Truth of the Matter is this: Some great Men, both of the Lords and
Commons, who were in the</i> Opposition to the Court, <i>objected that the</i>
Ministry <i>were not to be intrusted with such</i> Powers, <i>lest they should
abuse them; since they might, upon Occasion, by their Officers, either
remove or confine Persons not favoured by the Government, on Pretence
that their Houses were infected.</i></p>

<p><i>VAIN and groundless as these Fears were, yet the Clamours industriously
raised from them were so strong, that a great Officer in the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
thought fit to oblige his Enemies by giving way to them: and tho&#8217; a</i>
Motion <i>made in the House of Commons for repealing these two Clauses had
just been rejected; yet upon making the same in the House of Lords, with
his Consent, the thing was done.</i></p>

<p><i>WHETHER private or public Considerations had the greater Share in
bringing about this Compliance, I will not determine. Such</i>
Counter-Steps <i>will happen in a Government, where there is too much of</i>
Faction, <i>and too little of a</i> Public Spirit. <i>This I very well
remember, that a learned Prelate, now dead, who had more of</i> Political
<i>than of</i> Christian <i>Zeal, and was one who made the loudest Noise about
the</i> Quarantaine <i>Bill, frankly owned to me in Conversation, that tho&#8217;
the Directions were good, yet he and his Friends had resolved to take
that Opportunity of shewing their Disaffection to the</i> Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span><i>BUT after all, it contributed not a little to the carrying this Point,
that the Plague was now ceased at</i> Marseilles, <i>and a Stop put to its
Progress in the</i> Provinces. <i>And I cannot but take notice that this last
good Service was done by the same Method, which, tho&#8217; in a more moderate
way, I have here proposed. For it is well known that the Regent of</i>
France <i>did at last set Bounds to the Contagion by</i> Lines <i>and</i> Barriers
<i>guarded by Soldiers: which wise Resolution saved not only his own but
other Countries from the spreading of a Disease, which seems to have
been of as violent a kind as ever was brought into</i> Europe.</p>

<p><i>HOWEVER, if there were any Severity in Orders of this kind, every Man
ought to consider himself as a Member of the Society; by the Laws of
which as he receives many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span> Advantages, so he gives up somewhat of his
own private Rights to the Public: and must therefore be perfectly
satisfied with whatever is found necessary for the common Good; altho&#8217;
it may, on particular Occasions, bring upon him some Inconveniences and
Sufferings.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Salus Populi suprema Lex est.</p></div>

<p><i>Does any body complain of ill usage upon his House being ordered to be
blown up, to stop the Progress of a Fire which endangers the whole
Street: when he reflects that his Neighbour, who by this means escapes,
must have suffered the same Loss for his sake, had it so happened that
each had been in the other&#8217;s Habitation?</i></p>

<p><i>BUT in truth, there is no Cruelty, but on the contrary real Compassion
in these Regulations, with the Limitations I have made: and I am fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
persuaded that whoever with Judgment considers the nature of this
Disease, will easily see that the Rules here laid down are not only the
best, but indeed the only ones that can effectually answer the purpose.
And therefore I should not doubt but that, if this Calamity (which God
avert!) should be brought into our Country, even the Voice of the People
would cry out for Help in this way: notwithstanding wrong Notions of
their</i> Liberties <i>may sometimes over-possess their Minds, and make them,
even under the best of Governments, impatient of any</i> Restraints.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Origine and Nature of the Plague.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">My</span> Design in this Discourse being to propose what Measures I think most
proper to defend the Nation against the <i>Plague</i>, and for this End to
consider the Nature of <i>Pestilential Contagion</i> as far as is necessary
to set forth the Reasonableness of the Precepts I shall lay down; before
I proceed to any particular Directions, I shall enquire a little into
the Causes, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> the <i>Plague</i> arises, and by what Means the Infection
of it is spread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the most ancient Times <i>Plagues</i>, like many other Diseases, were
looked upon as <i>divine Judgments</i> sent to punish the Wickedness of
Mankind: and therefore the only Defence sought after was by Sacrifices
and Lustrations to appease the Anger of incensed Heaven.<span class="foot"><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> much soever may be said to justify Reflexions of this Kind, since we
are assured from sacred History, that divine Vengeance has been
sometimes executed by <i>Plagues</i>; yet it is certain, that such
Speculations pushed too far, were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>then attended with ill Consequences,
by obstructing Inquiries into natural Causes, and encouraging a supine
Submission to those Evils: against which the infinitely good and wise
Author of Nature has in most Cases provided proper Remedies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> this Account, in After-Ages, when the Profession of Physick came to
be founded upon the Knowledge of Nature, <i>Hippocrates</i> strenuously
opposed this Opinion, that <i>some particular Sicknesses were Divine, or
sent immediately from the Gods</i>; and affirmed, that <i>no Diseases came
more from the Gods than others, all coming from them, and yet all owning
their proper natural Causes: that the Sun, Cold, and Winds were</i> divine;
<i>the Changes of which, and their Influences on human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> Bodies, were
diligently to be considered by
a <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'Phsician'">Physician</ins></i>.<span class="foot"><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Which</span> general Position this great Author of Physick intended to be
understood with respect to <i>Plagues</i> as well as other Distempers: How
far he had reason herein, will in some measure appear, when we come to
search into the Causes of this Disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in order to this Inquiry, it will be convenient, in the first place,
to remove an erroneous Opinion some have entertained, that the <i>Plague</i>
differs not from a <i>common Fever</i> in any thing besides its greater
Violence. Whereas it is very evident, that since the <i>Small-Pox</i> and
<i>Measles</i> are allowed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> Distempers distinct in <i>Specie</i> from all
others, on account of certain Symptoms peculiar to them; so, for the
same reason, it ought to be granted, that the <i>Plague</i> no less differs
in Kind from ordinary Fevers: For there are a Set of distinguishing
Symptoms as essential to the <i>Pestilence</i>, as the respective Eruptions
are to the <i>Small-Pox</i> or <i>Measles</i>; which are indeed (as I have
mentioned in the Preface) each of them <i>Plagues</i> of a particular kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the <i>Small-Pox</i> discharges itself by <i>Pustules</i> raised in the Skin;
so in the <i>Plague</i> the noxious Humour is thrown out either by <i>Tumors</i>
in the Glands, as by a <i>Parotis</i>, <i>Bubo</i>, and the like; or by
<i>Carbuncles</i> thrust out upon any part of the Body. And these Eruptions
are so specific Marks of this Distemper, that one or other of them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
never absent: unless through the extreme Malignity of the Disease, or
Weakness of Nature, the Patient sinks, before there is time for any
Discharge to be made this way; that Matter, which should otherwise have
been cast out by external <i>Tumors</i>, seizing the <i>Viscera</i>, and producing
<i>Mortifications</i> in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> indeed it happens, by this means, that these <i>Tumors</i> in the
<i>Glands</i>, and <i>Carbuncles</i>, do not appear; just as a bad kind of the
<i>Small-Pox</i> in tender Constitutions sometimes proves fatal before the
<i>Eruption</i>, by a <i>Diarrh&oelig;a</i>, <i>H&aelig;morrhage</i>, or some such Effect of a
prevailing Malignity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>French</i> Physicians having distinguished the Sick at <i>Marseilles</i>
into five <i>Classes</i>, according to the Degrees of the Distemper,
observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> <i>Bubo&#8217;s</i>, and <i>Carbuncles</i>, in all of them, except in those of
the <i>first Class</i>, who were so terribly seized, that they died in a few
Hours, or at farthest in a Day or two, sinking under the Oppression,
Anxiety, and Faintness, into which they were thrown by the first Stroke
of the Disease; having Mortifications immediately produced in some of
the <i>Viscera</i>, as appeared upon the Dissection of their Bodies<span class="foot"><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></span>. And
this Observation of the <i>French</i> Physicians, which agrees with what
other Authors have remarked in former <i>Plagues</i>, fully proves, that
these Eruptions are so far from being caused solely by the greater
<i>Violence</i> of this Disease, than of other Fevers, that they are only
absent, when the Distemper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> extraordinary fierce; but otherwise they
constantly attend it, even when it has proved so mild, that the first
Notice, the Patient has had of his Infection, has been the Appearance of
such a <i>Tumor</i>: as, besides these <i>French</i> Physicians, other Authors of
the best Credit have assured us. From whence we must conclude, that
these <i>Eruptions</i> are no less a Specific Mark of this Disease, than
those are, by which the <i>Small Pox</i> and <i>Measles</i> are known and
distinguished. And as in the first <i>Class</i> of those attacked with the
Plague, so likewise in these two Distempers we often find the Patient to
dye by the violence of the Fever, before any Eruption of the Pustules
can be made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Circumstance of the Plague being mortal before any Eruptions
appeared, was attended with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> misfortune. The Physicians and
Surgeons appointed to examine the dead Bodies, finding none of the
distinguishing Marks of the Disease, reported to the Magistrates that it
was not the <i>Plague</i>; and persisted in their opinion, till one of them
suffered for his Ignorance, and himself, with part of his Family, dyed
by the Infection: this Assurance having prevented the necessary
Precautions<span class="foot"><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> this in particular shews us the difference between the true
<i>Plague</i>, and those <i>Fevers</i> of extraordinary Malignity, which are the
usual Forerunners of it, and are the natural Consequence of that ill
State of Air, we shall hereafter prove to attend all <i>Plagues</i>. For
since all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> Fevers, from which People recover without any Discharge
by Tumors in the Glands, or by <i>Carbuncles</i>, want the <i>characteristic</i>
Signs, which have been shewn to attend the slightest Cases of the true
<i>Plague</i>; we cannot, upon any just Ground, certainly conclude them to be
a less Degree only of that Distemper: but as far as appears, they are of
a different Nature, are not ordinarily <i>Contagious</i> like the <i>Plague</i>,
nor yet have any such necessary relation to it, but that such Fevers do
sometimes appear, without being followed by a real <i>Pestilence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other hand, I would not be understood to call every <i>Fever</i> a
<i>Plague</i>, which is followed by Eruptions resembling these here
mentioned: For as every <i>Boil</i> or <i>Pustule</i>, which breaks out upon the
Skin, is not an Indication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> <i>Small Pox</i>, nor every Swelling in
the <i>Groin</i> a <i>Venereal Bubo</i>; so there are <i>Carbuncles</i> not
Pestilential, and other Fevers, besides the <i>Plague</i>, which have their
Crisis by <i>Tumors</i> and <i>Abscesses</i>, and that sometimes even in the
<i>Parotid</i> or other Glands. There is indeed usually some difference
between these Swellings in the <i>Plague</i>, and in other Fevers, especially
in the time of their coming out: for in the <i>Plague</i> they discover
themselves sooner than in most other Cases. But the principal difference
between these Diseases, is, that the Plague is infectious, the other
not; at least not to any considerable Degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> this leads me to another Character of this Disease, whereby it is
distinguished from ordinary Fevers, which is the <i>Contagion</i>
accompanying it. This is a very ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> Observation. <i>Thucydides</i> makes
it a part of his Description of the <i>Plague</i> at <i>Athens</i><span class="foot"><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></span>; and
<i>Lucretius</i>, who has almost translated this Description of <i>Thucydides</i>,
dwells much <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>upon
it<span class="foot"><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></span>. <i>Aristotle</i> makes it
one of his<span class="foot"><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></span>
<i>Problems</i>, How the <i>Plague infects</i> those who approach to the Sick. And
what is of more Consequence, <i>Galen</i> himself is very clear in it<span class="foot"><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></span>;
for he has these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>words: <ins class="correction" title="hoti syndiatribein tois loim&ocirc;ttousin

is unsafe to be about those, who have the Plague, for fear of catching
it, as in the Itch</i>, &amp;c. Indeed this is a thing so evident, that we find
it at present the current Opinion of all Mankind, a very few Persons
only excepted, who have distinguished themselves by their Singularity in
maintaining the opposite Sentiment. And it is something strange that any
one should make a Question of a thing so obvious, which is proved
sufficiently by one Property only of the Disease, that whenever it
seizes one Person in a House, it immediately after attacks the greatest
part of the Family. This Effect of the <i>Plague</i> has been so remarkable
at all times, that whoever considers it well, cannot possibly, I think,
have any Doubt remaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> or require any stronger Argument to convince
him, that the Disease is infectious. For this very reason the
<i>Small-Pox</i> and <i>Measles</i> are generally allowed to be <i>contagious</i>;
because it is observed, that when either of these Diseases is got among
a Family, it usually seizes successively the greatest part of that
Family, who have not had it before: at least if such in the Family hold
free Communication with the Sick. And by the same Argument the <i>Plague</i>
must be concluded to be infectious likewise. It cannot be pretended,
that this is occasioned in the <i>Plague</i> from this only, that the sound
Persons are render&#8217;d more than ordinarily obnoxious to the unhealthy
Air, or whatever be the common Cause of the Disease, by being put into
fear and dispirited, upon seeing others in the same House taken sick:
For if this were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> Case, <i>Children</i>, who are too young to have any
Apprehensions upon this Account, would escape better than others, the
contrary of which has been always experienced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is true, some have not been attacked by the Disease, though
constantly attending about the Sick. But this is no Objection against
what is here advanced: for it is as easily understood how some Persons,
by a particular Advantage of Constitution, should resist Infection, as
how they should constantly breath a noxious Air without hurt. An odd
Observation of <i>Diemerbroek</i> deserves notice in this Place; That, part
of a Family removed into a Town free from the <i>Plague</i>, was observed by
him to be taken ill of it soon after the part left behind in the
diseased Town fell sick: which certainly could scarce have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> happened,
unless a Communication between the Healthy and the Sick, by Letters or
otherwise, was capable of causing it<span class="foot"><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></span>. Of the same Nature is a
Circumstance recorded by <i>Evagrius</i> of the <i>Plague</i>, which he describes,
and what, he owns, surprized him very much: That, many of those, who
left infected Places, were seized with the <i>Plague</i> in the Towns to
which they had retired, while the old Inhabitants of those Towns were
free from the Disease<span class="foot"><a name="f24.1" id="f24.1" href="#f24">[24]</a></span>. But to multiply Proofs of a thing so evident,
is needless; innumerable are at hand, and several will occasionally
occur in the following Parts of this Discourse, when we come to speak in
particular of the ways, by which this Infection is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> conveyed about. I
shall therefore say no more in this Place, but only, that all the
Appearances attending this Disease are very easily explained upon this
Principle, and are hardly to be accounted for upon any other. We learn
from hence the reason why when the <i>Plague</i> makes its first Appearance
in any Place, though the Number of Sick is exceeding small, yet the
Disease usually operates upon them in the most violent manner, and is
attended with its very worst Symptoms. Now was the Disease produced not
by imported <i>Contagion</i>, but from some Cause, which had its Original in
the diseased Place, and consequently from a Cause gradually bred, the
contrary must happen: the Diseased would at first not only be few in
Number, but their Sickness likewise more moderate than afterwards, when
the morbific Causes were raised to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> greatest Malignity. From the
same Principle we see the reason, why People have often remained in
Safety in a diseased Town, only by shutting themselves up from all
Communication with such, as might be suspected of giving them the
Disease. When the <i>Plague</i> was last in <i>England</i>, while it was in the
Town of <i>Cambridge</i>, the Colleges remained entirely free by using this
Precaution. In the <i>Plague</i> at <i>Rome</i> in the Years 1656 and 1657, the
<i>Monasteries</i> and <i>Nunneries</i>, for the most part, defended themselves by
the same Means<span class="foot"><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></span>: Whereas at <i>Naples</i>, where the <i>Plague</i> was a little
before, these <i>Religious Houses</i>, from their Neglect herein, did not
escape so well<span class="foot"><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></span>. Nay
the Infection <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>entered none of the <i>Prisons</i> at
<i>Rome</i><span class="foot"><a name="f27.1" id="f27.1" href="#f27">[27]</a></span>, though the Nastiness of those Places exposes them very much.
But, to avoid Prolixity, I shall give only one Instance more. I think it
cannot be explained in any other reasonable manner, how the last
<i>Plague</i> in the City of <i>London</i>, which broke out in the parish of St.
<i>Giles&#8217;s in the Fields</i> towards the latter end of the Year 1664, should
lie a-sleep from <i>Christmas</i> to the middle of <i>February</i>, and then break
out again in the same Parish; and after another long rest till <i>April</i>,
shew itself again in the same Place<span class="foot"><a name="f28.1" id="f28.1" href="#f28">[28]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> proceed: Whoever examines the Histories of <i>Plagues</i> in all times,
which have been described with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>any Exactness, will find very few, that
do not agree in these essential Marks, whereby the <i>Plague</i> may be
distinguished from other <i>Fevers</i>. I confess an Instance or two may be
found to the contrary; perhaps the History of our own Country furnishes
the most remarkable of any<span class="foot"><a name="f29.1" id="f29.1" href="#f29">[29]</a></span>. But Examples of this kind are so very
rare, that I think it must be concluded, that the <i>Plague</i> is usually
one and the same Distemper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the next place I shall endeavour to shew, that the <i>Plague</i> has
always the same Original, and is brought from <i>Africa</i>, the Country
which has entail&#8217;d upon us two other infectious Distempers, the
<i>Small-Pox</i> and <i>Measles</i>. In all Countries indeed <i>Epidemic Diseases</i>
extraordinarily mortal, are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> bred in <i>Goals</i>, <i>Sieges</i>,
<i>Camps</i>, &amp;c. which Authors have often in a large Sense called
<i>Pestilential</i>: But the true <i>Plague</i>, which is attended with the
distinguishing Symptoms before described, and which spreads from Country
to Country, I take to be an <i>African</i> Fever bred in <i>&AElig;thiopia</i> or
<i>Egypt</i>, and the <i>Infection</i> of it carried by Trade into the other Parts
of the World.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the Observation of <i>Pliny</i>, that the <i>Pestilence</i> always travels
from the <i>Southern</i> Parts of the World to the <i>Western</i>, that is, in his
Phrase, into <i>Europe</i><span class="foot"><a name="f30.1" id="f30.1" href="#f30">[30]</a></span>. And the most accurate Accounts in all Times
of this Disease, wherever it has raged, bring it from <i>Africa</i>.
<i>Thucydides</i><span class="foot"><a name="f31.1" id="f31.1" href="#f31">[31]</a></span>, in his
admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Description of the famous <i>Plague</i>
of <i>Athens</i>, says, that it began in Upper <i>&AElig;thiopia</i>, then came into
<i>Egypt</i>, from whence it was spread first into <i>Persia</i>, and afterwards
into <i>Greece</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is in all ancient History no Account of any <i>Plague</i> so dreadful
as that, which broke out at <i>Constantinople</i> in the time of the Emperor
<i>Justinian A. D.</i> 543. This is said to have spread its Infection over
all the Earth, and to have lasted fifty two Years. The History of it is
very well told by <i>Evagrius</i><span class="foot"><a name="f32.1" id="f32.1" href="#f32">[32]</a></span>, and yet more learnedly by
<i>Procopius</i><span class="foot"><a name="f33.1" id="f33.1" href="#f33">[33]</a></span>: and they both observe, that the Distemper had its Birth
in <i>&AElig;thiopia</i> or <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span class="smcap">This</span> is likewise agreeable to the modern Relations of Travellers and
Merchants from <i>Turkey</i>, who generally inform us, that the frequent
<i>Plagues</i>, which depopulate that Country, are brought thither from the
Coast of <i>Africa</i>: insomuch that at <i>Smyrna</i>, and other Ports of that
Coast, they often know the very Ship which brings it. And, in these
latter Ages, since our Trade with <i>Turkey</i> has been pretty constant, the
<i>Plagues</i> in these Parts of <i>Europe</i> have evidently been brought from
thence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late <i>Plague</i> in <i>France</i> came indisputably from <i>Turkey</i>, as I
shall particularly shew in some of the following Pages. The <i>Plague</i>,
which broke out at <i>Dantzick</i> in the Year 1709, and spread from thence
to <i>Hamburgh</i>, <i>Copenhagen</i>, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> Cities in the <i>North</i>, made its
way thither from <i>Constantinople</i> through <i>Poland</i>, &amp;c. And the last
<i>Plague</i> in this City, if we may believe Dr. <i>Hodges</i>, had the same
Original, being brought to us from <i>Holland</i>, but carried to them by
<i>Cotton</i> imported from <i>Turkey</i><span class="foot"><a name="f34.1" id="f34.1" href="#f34">[34]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greatest <i>Mortality</i> that has happen&#8217;d in later Ages, was about the
middle of the fourteenth Century; when the <i>Plague</i> seized Country after
Country for five Years together<span class="foot"><a name="f35.1" id="f35.1" href="#f35">[35]</a></span>. In the Year 1346 it raged in
<i>Egypt</i>, <i>Turkey</i>, <i>Greece</i>, <i>Syria</i>, and the <i>East-Indies</i>; in 1347
some Ships from the <i>Levant</i> carried it to <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Pisa</i>, <i>Genoa</i>,
&amp;c. in 1348 it got into <i>Savoy</i>, <i>Provence</i>, <i>Dauphiny</i>, <i>Catalonia</i>,
and <i>Castile</i>, &amp;c. in 1349 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>it seized <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Ireland</i>,
and <i>Flanders</i>; and the next Year <i>Germany</i>, <i>Hungary</i> and <i>Denmark</i>:
and in all Places, where it came, it made such heavy Destruction, that
it is said to have dispeopled the Earth of more than half its
Inhabitants<span class="foot"><a name="f36.1" id="f36.1" href="#f36">[36]</a></span>. Now since <i>Africa</i> had a share of this <i>Plague</i> in the
very beginning, I question not but it had its first Rise in that
Country; and not in <i>China</i>, as <i>M. Villani</i>, in his History of those
Times, relates from the Report of <i>Genoese</i> Seamen, who came from those
Parts, and said it was occasion&#8217;d there by a great <i>Ball of Fire</i>, which
either burst out of the Earth, or fell down from Heaven<span class="foot"><a name="f37.1" id="f37.1" href="#f37">[37]</a></span>. But this
Relation is so very incredible, that I cannot think we ought at all to
rely upon it: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>seeing we have no Instance of a <i>Plague</i>, which was
originally bred in that Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very remarkable, that the several Countries of <i>Europe</i> have
always suffered more or less in this way, according as they have had a
greater or lesser Commerce with <i>Africa</i>; or with those Parts of the
<i>East</i>, that have traded thither. Which Observation, by the by, may help
to solve a Difficulty concerning the great Increase of People among the
<i>Northern</i> Nations in ancient Times, more than at present; for in those
Ages, having no Communication at all with <i>Africa</i>, they were not wasted
with <i>Plagues</i>, as they have been since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the People of <i>Marseilles</i>, from the first Foundation of their City
by the <i>Phoceans</i>, were famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> for Trade, and made long Voyages
Southwards on the <i>African</i> Coast<span class="foot"><a name="f38.1" id="f38.1" href="#f38">[38]</a></span>; so they have in all times been
very liable to the Plague. A French Author<span class="foot"><a name="f39.1" id="f39.1" href="#f39">[39]</a></span> in a History of the late
Plague at <i>Marseilles</i> reckons up twenty Plagues that have happened in
that City; notwithstanding it is by its situation one of the most
healthy and pleasant Places in <i>France</i>, and the least subject to
epidemic Distempers. But if we had no Records of this in History, an odd
Custom among them, mentioned in Antiquity<span class="foot"><a name="f40.1" id="f40.1" href="#f40">[40]</a></span>, of the way they made use
of to clear themselves from this Distemper, would be a proof of it.
Their manner at such times was, that some one poor Man offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> himself
to be maintained at the publick Expence with delicate Food for a whole
Year: at the end of which he was led about the City dressed in
consecrated Garments and Herbs; and being loaded with Curses as he went
along, that the Evils of the Citizens might fall upon him, he was at
last thrown into the Sea<span class="foot"><a name="f41.1" id="f41.1" href="#f41">[41]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class="smcap">Agreeable</span> to this Remark upon Trade is the Observation of <i>Procopius</i> in
his forecited History, that the <i>Plague</i> was always found to spread from
<i>Maritime</i> Places into the <i>Inland</i> Countries: which has ever since been
confirmed by Experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> shewn this Disease to be a Distemper of a distinct Species, and
to take its Rise only in <i>Africa</i>; we must next seek for its Cause in
that Country and no where else. We ought therefore to consider, what
there is peculiar to that Country, which can reasonably be supposed
capable of producing it. Wherefore I shall briefly set down as much as
serves for this purpose of the State of <i>Grand Cairo</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, and of
<i>&AElig;thiopia</i>, the two great Seminaries of the <i>Plague</i>: Travellers
relating that these Countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> are more infested with it than most other
Parts of <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<p><i>GRAND CAIRO</i> is crouded with vast Numbers of Inhabitants, who for the
most part live very poorly, and nastily; the Streets are very narrow,
and close: it is situate in a sandy Plain at the Foot of a Mountain,
which by keeping off the Winds, that would refresh the Air, makes the
<i>Heats</i> very stifling. Through the midst of it passes a great <i>Canal</i>,
which is filled with Water at the overflowing of the <i>Nile</i>; and after
the River is decreased, is gradually dried up: Into this the People
throw all manner of Filth, Carrion, <i>&amp;c.</i> so that the Stench which
arises from this, and the Mud together, is insufferably offensive<span class="foot"><a name="f42.1" id="f42.1" href="#f42">[42]</a></span>.
In this Posture of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>things, the <i>Plague</i> every Year constantly preys
upon the Inhabitants; and is only stopt, when the <i>Nile</i>, by
overflowing, washes away this Load of Filth; the <i>Cold Winds</i>, which set
in at the same time, lending their Assistance, by purifying the Air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> <i>&AElig;thiopia</i> those prodigious Swarms of <i>Locusts</i>, which at some times
cause a Famine, by devouring the Fruits of the Earth, unless they happen
to be carried by the Winds clear off into the Sea, are observed to
entail a new Mischief upon the Country, when they die and rot, by
raising a <i>Pestilence</i><span class="foot"><a name="f43.1" id="f43.1" href="#f43">[43]</a></span>; the Putrefaction being hightened by the
excessive <i>Intemperance of the Climate</i>, which is so very great in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Country, that it is infested with violent <i>Rains</i> at one Season of the
Year, for three or four Months together<span class="foot"><a name="f44.1" id="f44.1" href="#f44">[44]</a></span>. And it is particularly
observed of this Country, that the <i>Plague</i> usually invades it, whenever
Rains fall during the sultry Heats of <i>July</i> and <i>August</i><span class="foot"><a name="f45.1" id="f45.1" href="#f45">[45]</a></span>, that is,
as <i>Lucretius</i> expresses it, when the Earth is</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Intempestivis pluviisque et solibus icta</i><span class="foot"><a name="f46.1" id="f46.1" href="#f46">[46]</a></span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> if we compare this last Remark of the <i>Intemperance of the Climate</i>
in <i>&AElig;thiopia</i>, with what the <i>Arabian</i> Physicians<span class="foot"><a name="f47.1" id="f47.1" href="#f47">[47]</a></span>, who lived near
these Countries, declare, that <i>Pestilences</i> are brought by
<i>unseasonable</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Moistures, Heats, and want of Winds; I believe we shall
be fully instructed in the usual Cause of this Disease. Which from all
these Observations compared together, I conclude to arise from the
<i>Putrefaction</i> so constantly generated in these Countries, when <i>that</i>
is hightened and increased by the ill State of Air now described; and
especially from the <i>Putrefaction</i> of animal Substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very plain, that animal Bodies are capable of being altered into a
Matter fit to breed this Disease: because this is the Case of every one
who is sick of it, the Humours in him being corrupted into a Substance
which will <i>infect</i> others. And it is not improbable, that the volatile
Parts with which Animals abound, may in some ill States of Air in the
sultry Heats of <i>Africa</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> converted by Putrefaction into a Substance
of the same kind: since in these colder Regions, we sometimes find them
to contract a greater Degree of Acrimony than most other Substances will
do by <i>putrefying</i>, and also more dangerous for Men to come within the
reach of their Action; as in those pernicious, and even poysonous
Juices, which are sometimes generated in corrupted Carcasses: Of which I
have formerly given one very remarkable Instance<span class="foot"><a name="f48.1" id="f48.1" href="#f48">[48]</a></span>, and, if it were
necessary, many more might be produced, especially in <i>hydropic Bodies</i>,
and in <i>cancerous Tumors</i>. Nay more, we find <i>animal Putrefaction</i>
sometimes to produce in these <i>Northern</i> Climates very fatal Distempers,
though they do not arise to the Malignity of the true <i>Plague</i>: For such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><i>Fevers</i> are often bred, where a large Number of People are closely
confined together; as in <i>Goals</i>, <i>Sieges</i>, and <i>Camps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> perhaps it may not be here amiss to remark, that the <i>Egyptians</i> of
old were so sensible how much the <i>Putridness</i> of dead Animals
contributed towards breeding the <i>Plague</i>, that they worshipped the Bird
<i>Ibis</i> for the Service it did in devouring great Numbers of Serpents;
which they observed did hurt by their Stench when dead, as well as by
their Bite when alive<span class="foot"><a name="f49.1" id="f49.1" href="#f49">[49]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> no kind of <i>Putrefaction</i> is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ever hightened in these <i>European</i>
Countries to a degree capable of producing the true <i>Plague</i>: and we
learn from the Observation of the <i>Arabian</i> Physicians, that some
Indisposition of the <i>Air</i> is necessary in the hottest Climates, either
to cause so exalted a Corruption of the forementioned Substances, or at
least to enforce upon Mens Bodies the Action of the <i>Effluvia</i> exhaled
from those Substances, while they putrefy. Both which Effects may well
be expected from the sensible ill Qualities of the <i>Air</i> before
described, whenever they continue and exert their Force together any
considerable time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> I have here advanced of the first Original of the <i>Plague</i>, appears
to me so reasonable, that I cannot enough wonder at Authors for quitting
the Consideration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> such manifest Causes for <i>Hidden Qualities</i>; such
as <i>Malignant Influences of the Heavens</i>; <i>Arsenical</i>, <i>Bituminous</i>, or
other <i>Mineral Effluvia</i>, with the like imaginary or uncertain Agents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> however I do not say with design absolutely to exclude all
Disorders in the <i>Air</i>, that are more latent than the intemperate <i>Heat</i>
and <i>Moisture</i> before mentioned, from a Share in increasing and
promoting the Infection of the <i>Plague</i>, where it is once bred: for I
rather think this must sometimes be the Case; like to what is observed
among us in relation to another infectious Distemper, namely, the
<i>Small-Pox</i>, which is most commonly spread, and propagated by the same
manifest Qualities of the <i>Air</i> as those here described: Notwithstanding
which, this Distemper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> is sometimes known to rage with great Violence in
the very opposite Constitution of <i>Air</i>, <i>viz.</i> in the Winter during dry
and frosty Weather. But to breed a Distemper, and to give force to it
when bred, are two different things. And though we should allow any such
secret Change in the <i>Air</i> to assist in the first Production of the
Disease; yet it may justly be censured in these Writers, that they
should undertake to determine the <i>Specific Nature</i> of these secret
Changes and Alterations, which we have no means at all of discovering:
Since they do not shew themselves in any such sensible manner, as to
come directly under our Examination; nor yet do their Effects, in
producing the <i>Plague</i>, point out any thing of their <i>Specific Nature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="smcap">All</span> that we know, is this, that the Cause of the <i>Plague</i>, whatever it
be, is of such a Nature, that when taken into the Body, it works such
Changes in the Blood and Juices, as to produce this Disease, by suddenly
giving some Parts of the Humours such corrosive Qualities, that they
either excite inward <i>Inflammations</i> and <i>Gangrenes</i>, or push out
<i>Carbuncles</i> and <i>Bubo&#8217;s</i>; the <i>Matter</i> of which, when suppurated,
communicates the like Disease to others: But of the manner how this is
done, I shall discourse in the following Chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>
<h3><i>Of the Causes which spread the Plague.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">I Have</span> been thus particular in tracing the <i>Plague</i> up to its first
Origine, in order to remove, as much as possible, all Objection against
what I shall say of the Causes, which excite and propagate it among us.
This is done by <i>Contagion</i>. Those who are Strangers to the full Power
of <i>this</i>, that is, those who do not understand how subtile it is, and
how widely the Distemper may be spread by <i>Infection</i>, ascribe the Rise
of it wholly to the malignant Quality of the <i>Air</i> in all Places,
wherever it happens; and, on the other hand, some have thought that the
Consideration of the infectious Nature of the Disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> must exclude all
regard to the Influence of the <i>Air</i>: Whereas the <i>Contagion</i>
accompanying the Disease, and the Disposition of the <i>Air</i> to promote
that <i>Contagion</i>, ought equally to be considered; both being necessary
to give the Distemper full force. The Design therefore of this Chapter,
is to make a proper Balance between these two, and to set just Limits to
the Effects of each.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this purpose, I shall reduce the Causes, which spread the <i>Plague</i>,
to three, <i>Diseased Persons</i>, <i>Goods transported from infected Places</i>,
and <i>a corrupted State of Air</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are several Diseases, which will be communicated from the Sick to
others: and this not done after the same manner in all. The
<i>Hydrophobia</i> is communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> no other way than by mixing the morbid
Juices of the diseased Animal immediately with the Blood of the sound,
by a <i>Bite</i>, or what is analogous thereto; the <i>Itch</i> is given by
<i>simple Contact</i>; the <i>Lues Venerea</i> not without <i>a closer Contact</i>; but
the <i>Measles</i>, <i>Small-Pox</i>, and <i>Plague</i> are caught by a <i>near Approach</i>
only to the Sick: for in these three last Diseases Persons are render&#8217;d
obnoxious to them only by residing in the same House, and conversing
with the Sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> it appears by the Experiments mentioned in the <i>Preface</i>, of giving
the <i>Plague</i> to <i>Dogs</i> by putting the <i>Bile</i>, <i>Blood</i> or <i>Urine</i> from
infected Persons, into their Veins, that the whole mass of the animal
Fluids in this Disease is highly corrupted and putrefied. It is
therefore easy to conceive how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> the <i>Effluvia</i> or Fumes from Liquors so
affected may taint the ambient Air. And this will more especially
happen, when the Humours are in the greatest Fermentation, that is, at
the Highth of the Fever: as it is observed that fermenting Liquors do at
the latter end of their intestine Motion throw off a great Quantity of
their most subtile and active Particles. And this Discharge will be
chiefly made upon those Glands of the Body, in which the Secretions are
the most copious, and the most easily increased: such are those of the
Mouth and Skin. From these therefore the Air will be impregnated with
<i>pestiferous Atoms</i>: which being taken into the Body of a sound Person
will, in the Nature of a <i>Ferment</i>, put the Fluids there into the like
Agitation and Disorder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><span class="smcap">The</span> Body, I suppose, receives them these two ways, by the <i>Breath</i>, and
by the <i>Skin</i>; but chiefly by the former.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I think</span> it certain that <i>Respiration</i> does always communicate to the
Blood some Parts from the Air: Which is proved from this Observation,
that the same Quantity of Air will not suffice long for breathing,
though it be deprived of none of those Qualities, by which it is fitted
to inflate the Lungs and agitate the Blood, the Uses commonly ascribed
to it. And this is farther confirm&#8217;d by what the learned Dr. <i>Halley</i>
has inform&#8217;d me, that when he was several Fathom under Water in his
<i>Diving Engine</i>, and breathing an Air much more condensed than the
natural, he observed himself to breath more slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> than usual: Which
makes it more than probable, that this conveying to the Blood some
subtile Parts from the Air, is the chief Use of <i>Respiration</i>; since
when a greater Quantity of <i>Air</i> than usual was taken in at a time, and
consequently more of these subtile Parts received at once by the Blood,
a less frequent <i>Respiration</i> sufficed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the <i>Skin</i>, since there is a continual Discharge made thro&#8217; its
innumerable <i>Pores</i>, of the matter of <i>insensible Perspiration</i> and
<i>Sweat</i>; it is very possible that the same Passages may admit subtile
Corpuscles, which may penetrate into the inward Parts. Nay it is very
plain that they do so, from what we observe upon the outward Application
of <i>Ointments</i> and warm <i>Bathings</i>: which have their Effects by their
finest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> active Parts insinuating themselves into the Blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is commonly thought, that the <i>Blood</i> only is affected in these Cases
by the morbific <i>Effluvia</i>. But I am of opinion, that there is another
Fluid in the Body, which is, especially in the beginning, equally, if
not more, concerned in this Affair: I mean the <i>Liquid of the Nerves</i>,
usually called the <i>Animal Spirits</i>. As <i>this</i> is the immediate
Instrument of all Motion and Sensation, and has a great Agency in all
the glandular Secretions, and in the Circulation of the Blood itself;
any considerable Alteration made in it must be attended with dangerous
Consequences. It is not possible that the whole Mass of Blood should be
corrupted in so short a Time as that, in which the fatal Symptoms, in
some Cases, discover themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Those Patients of the <i>first Class</i>,
mentioned in the beginning of this Discourse, particularly the <i>Porters</i>
who opened the infected Bales of Goods in the <i>Lazaretto</i>&#8217;s of
<i>Marseilles</i>, died upon the first Appearance of Infection, as it were by
a sudden Stroke; being seized with Rigors, Tremblings, Heart-Sickness,
Vomitings, Giddiness and Heaviness of the Head, an universal Languor and
Inquietude; the Pulse low and unequal: and Death insued sometimes in a
few Hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effects</span> so sudden must be owing to the Action of some Corpuscles of
great Force insinuated into, and changing the Properties of, another
subtle and active Fluid in the Body: and such an one, no doubt, is the
<i>Nervous Liquor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not to be expected that we should be able to explain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>particular manner by which this is brought about. We know too little of
the Frame of the Universe, and of the Laws of <i>Attractions</i>,
<i>Repulsions</i> and <i>Cohesions</i> among the minutest Parcels of Matter, to be
able to determine all the Ways by which they affect one another,
especially within animal Bodies, the most delicate and complicated of
all the known Works of Nature. But we may perhaps make a probable
Conjecture upon the Matter. Our great Philosopher, whose surprising
Discoveries have exceeded the utmost Expectations of the most
penetrating Minds, has demonstrated that there is diffused through the
Universe a <i>subtile</i> and <i>elastic Fluid</i> of great Force and Activity.
This he supposes to be the Cause of the <i>Refraction</i> and <i>Reflection</i> of
the Rays of Light; and that by its <i>Vibrations</i> Light communicates Heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to Bodies: and, moreover, <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'that that'">that</ins> this readily pervading all Bodies,
produces many of their Effects upon one another<span class="foot"><a name="f50.1" id="f50.1" href="#f50">[50]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> it is not improbable that the <i>Animal Spirits</i> are a thin Liquor,
separated in the Brain, and from thence derived into the Nerves, of such
a Nature that it admits, and has incorporated with it, a great Quantity
of this <i>elastic Fluid</i>: which makes it a vital Substance of great
Energy. And a Liquor of this kind must be very susceptible of
Alterations from other active Bodies of a different Nature from it, if
they approach to and are mixed with it: as we see some <i>Chemical
Spirits</i> upon their being put together, fall into a Fermentation, and
make a Composition of a quite different kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> therefore
we allow the <i>Effluvia</i> or <i>Exhalations</i> from a corrupted
Mass of Humours in a Body that has the <i>Plague</i> to be volatile and firey
Particles, carrying with them the Qualities, of those fermenting Juices
from which they proceed; it will not be hard to conceive how these may,
when received into the <i>nervous Fluid</i> of a sound Person, excite in it
such intestine Motions as may make it to partake of their own
Properties, and become more unfit for the Purposes of the animal
Oeconomy. But of this more in another Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one means by which the <i>Plague</i>, when once bred, is spread and
increased: but the second of the forementioned Causes, namely, <i>Goods
from infected Places</i>, extends the Mischief much wider.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> By the
preceding Cause, the <i>Plague</i> may be spread from <i>Person</i> to <i>Person</i>,
from <i>House</i> to <i>House</i>, or perhaps from <i>Town</i> to <i>Town</i>, tho&#8217; not to
any great Distance; but this carries it into the remotest Regions. From
hence the trading Parts of <i>Europe</i> have their principal Apprehensions,
and universally have recourse to <i>Quarantaines</i> for their Security. The
Universality of which Practice is a strong Argument, that <i>Merchandize</i>
will communicate <i>Infection</i>: for one cannot imagine, that so many
Countries should agree in such a Custom without the most weighty
Reasons. But besides, there is not wanting express Proof of this, from
particular Examples, where this Injury has been done by several sorts of
Goods carried from infected Places to others. Some of these I shall
hereafter be obliged to mention; at present I shall confine my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> self to
three Instances only. The <i>first</i> shall be of the Entrance of the
<i>Plague</i> into <i>Rome</i> in the Year 1656, which we are assured was conveyed
thither from <i>Naples</i> by Clothes and other Wares from that Place,
brought first to Port <i>Neptuno</i>, and carried from thence to the
Neighbouring Castle of St. <i>Lawrence</i>: which after having been kept some
time there, were conveyed into <i>Rome</i><span class="foot"><a name="f51.1" id="f51.1" href="#f51">[51]</a></span>. The <i>second</i> Instance I shall
take is from the Account given us of the Entrance of the Plague into
<i>Marseilles</i><span class="foot"><a name="f52.1" id="f52.1" href="#f52">[52]</a></span>; which being drawn up with great Exactness, may be the
more rely&#8217;d on. It appears indisputably by this Account, that the
Mischief was brought thither by Goods from the <i>Levant</i>. For the first,
who had the Distemper, was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>one of the <i>Crew</i> of the <i>Ship</i>, which
brought those <i>Goods</i>: the next were those, who attended upon the same
<i>Goods</i>, while they were under <i>Quarantaine</i>; and soon after the
<i>Surgeon</i>, whom the Magistrates of <i>Marseilles</i> appointed to examine the
Bodies of those, who died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Relation, if duly consider&#8217;d, is, I believe, sufficient to remove
all the Doubts any one can have about the Power of <i>Merchandize</i> to
convey <i>Infection</i>: for it affords all the Evidence, the most scrupulous
can reasonably desire. Possibly there might be some Fever of
extraordinary Malignity in <i>Marseilles</i>, such as is commonly called
<i>Pestilential</i>, before the Arrival of these Goods: But no such Fever has
any indisputable Right to the Title of <i>Pestilence</i>, as I have before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
shewn. On the contrary, these two, the real <i>Pestilence</i>, and such
<i>Pestilential Fevers</i>, must carefully be distinguished, if we design to
avoid all Mistakes in reasoning upon these Subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> such Fever of uncommon Malignity, I say, might perhaps be in
<i>Marseilles</i> before the Arrival of these Goods. There might likewise
perhaps be an Instance or two of <i>Fevers</i> attended with <i>Eruptions</i>,
bearing some Resemblance to those of the <i>Plague</i>: for such I my self
have sometimes seen here in <i>London</i>. But it is not conceivable, that
there should be any Appearance of the true <i>Plague</i> before that time:
for it was full six Weeks from the time of the Sailor&#8217;s Death, which had
given the Alarm, and raised a general Attention, before the Magistrates
received Information of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> any one&#8217;s dying of the <i>Plague</i> in the City.
And I believe it was never known, that the <i>Plague</i>, being once broke
out, gave so long a Truce in hot Weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Plague</i>, which has this present Year almost depopulated <i>Messina</i>,
affords a <i>third</i> Instance of the same kind. By an authentic Relation of
it, published here<span class="foot"><a name="f53.1" id="f53.1" href="#f53">[53]</a></span> we are informed, that a <i>Genoese</i> Vessel from the
<i>Levant</i>, arrived at that City; and upon notice given that a Sailor, who
had touched some Cases of <i>Cotton Stuffs</i> bought up at <i>Patrasso</i> in the
<i>Morea</i>, where the Distemper then raged, was dead of the Plague, in the
Voyage; the Ship was put under <i>Quarantaine</i>: during which time the
<i>Cotton Stuffs</i> were privately landed. The Master and some Sailors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>dying three days after, the Vessel was burnt. These Goods lay for some
time concealed, but were soon after publickly sold: upon which the
Disease immediately broke out in that <i>Quarter</i> where they were opened;
and afterwards was spread through the whole City.</p>

<p>I think it not improper, for the fuller Confirmation of the present
Point, to give a Relation communicated to me by a Person of
unquestionable Credit, of the like Effect from Goods, in respect to the
<i>Small-Pox</i>; which Distemper is frequently carried in the Nature of the
<i>Plague</i> both to the <i>East</i> and <i>West-Indies</i> from these Countries, and
was once carried from the <i>East-Indies</i> to the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>, in
the following manner. About the Year 1718, a ship from the <i>East-Indies</i>
arrived at that Place: In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the Voyage three Children had been sick of
the <i>Small-Pox</i>: The foul Linen used about them was put into a Trunk,
and lock&#8217;d up. At the Ship&#8217;s Landing, this was taken out, and given to
some of the Natives to be washed: Upon handling the Linen, they were
immediately seized with the <i>Small-Pox</i>, which spread into the Country
for many Miles, and made such a Desolation, that it was almost
dispeopled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been thought so difficult to explain the manner how <i>Goods</i>
retain the Seeds of <i>Contagion</i>, that some<span class="foot"><a name="f54.1" id="f54.1" href="#f54">[54]</a></span> Authors have imagined
<i>Infection</i> to be performed by the Means of <i>Insects</i>; the <i>Eggs</i> of
which may be conveyed from Place to Place, and make the Disease when
they come to be <i>hatched</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> But as this is a Supposition grounded upon
no manner of Observation, so I think there is no need to have recourse
to it. If, as we have conjectured, the <i>Matter</i> of <i>Contagion</i> be an
active Substance generated chiefly from animal Corruption; it is not
hard to conceive how this may be lodged and preserved in soft porous
Bodies, which are kept pressed close together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all know how long a time <i>Perfumes</i> hold their Scent, if wrapt up in
proper Coverings: And it is very remarkable, that the strongest of
these, like the Matter we are treating of, are mostly <i>animal Juices</i>,
as <i>Mosch</i>, <i>Civet</i>, &amp;c. and that the Substances, found most fit to keep
them in, are the very same with those, which are most apt to receive and
communicate Infection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> as <i>Furrs</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Silk</i>, <i>Hair</i>, <i>Wool</i>,
<i>Cotton</i>, <i>Flax</i>, &amp;c. the greatest part of which are likewise of the
<i>animal</i> kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> indeed can give us so just a Notion of <i>Infection</i>, and more
clearly represent the manner of it, than <i>Odoriferous</i> Bodies. Some of
<i>these</i> do strangely revive the animal Spirits; others instantaneously
depress and sink them: We may therefore conceive that, what active
particles emitted from any such Substances do, is in the like way done
by <i>Pestiferous</i> Bodies; so that <i>Contagion</i> is no more than the effect
of volatile offensive Matter drawn into the Body by our <i>Smelling</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> third Cause we assigned for the spreading of <i>Contagion</i>, was a
corrupted State of <i>Air</i>. Although the <i>Air</i> be in a right State, yet a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
sick Person may infect those who are very near him: As we find the
<i>Pestilence</i> to continue sometimes among the <i>Crew</i> of a Ship, after
they have sailed out of the Infectious Air wherein the Disease was first
caught. A remarkable Accident of this Nature is recorded to have
happened in the <i>Plague</i> at <i>Genoa</i> in the Year 1656. Eleven Persons put
to Sea in a <i>Felucca</i>, with design to withdraw themselves from the
<i>Contagion</i>, and retire into <i>Provence</i>; but one of them falling sick of
the <i>Plague</i> soon after they had imbarked, infected the rest; insomuch
that others being taken ill, and dying in their turns, they were not
admitted any where, but were forced to return from whence they came: and
by that time the Boat arrived again at <i>Genoa</i> no more than one of them
survived<span class="foot"><a name="f55.1" id="f55.1" href="#f55">[55]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><span class="smcap">However</span> in this Case the Malady does not usually spread far, the
<i>contagious</i> Particles being soon dispersed and lost. But when in a
corrupt Disposition of the <i>Air</i> the <i>contagious</i> Particles meet with
the subtile Parts generated by that Corruption, by uniting with them
they become much more active and powerful, and likewise of a more
durable Nature; so as to form an infectious Matter capable of conveying
the Mischief to a greater distance from the diseased Body, out of which
it was produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> general, a <i>hot Air</i> is more disposed to spread <i>Contagion</i> than a
cold one, as no one can doubt, who considers how much all kinds of
<i>Effluvia</i> are farther diffused in a <i>warm Air</i>, than in the contrary.
But moreover, that State of <i>Air</i>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> unseasonable Moisture and want
of Winds are added to its Heat, which gives birth to the <i>Plague</i> in
some Countries, will doubtless promote it in all. For <i>Hippocrates</i> sets
down the same Description of a <i>Pestilential State</i> of Air in his
Country, as the <i>Arabians</i> do of the Constitution, which gives Rise to
the <i>Plague</i> in <i>Africa</i><span class="foot"><a name="f56.1" id="f56.1" href="#f56">[56]</a></span>. <i>Mercurialis</i> assures us the same
Constitution of <i>Air</i> attended the <i>Pestilence</i> in his time at
<i>Padua</i><span class="foot"><a name="f57.1" id="f57.1" href="#f57">[57]</a></span>: and <i>Gassendus</i> observed the same in the <i>Plague</i> of
<i>Digne</i><span class="foot"><a name="f58.1" id="f58.1" href="#f58">[58]</a></span>. Besides, it is easy to shew how the <i>Air</i>, by the sensible
ill Qualities discoursed of in the last Chapter, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>should favour
infectious Diseases, by rendering the Body obnoxious to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed</span> other hurtful Qualities of the <i>Air</i> are more to be regarded than
its Heat alone: for the <i>Plague</i> is sometimes stopt, while the Heat of
the Season increases, upon the Emendation of the <i>Air</i> in other
respects. At <i>Smyrna</i> the <i>Plague</i>, which is yearly carried thither by
Ships, constantly ceases about the 24th of <i>June</i>, by the dry and clear
Weather they always have at that time: the unwholsome Damps being then
dissipated that annoy the Country in the <i>Spring</i>. However, the Heat of
the Air is of so much Consequence, that if any Ship brings it in the
Winter Months of <i>November</i>, <i>December</i>, <i>January</i>, or <i>February</i>, it
never spreads: but if later in the Year, as in <i>April</i> or afterwards,
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> continues till the time before mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> moreover, what was said before of some latent Disorders in the <i>Air</i>
having a share in spreading the <i>Plague</i>, will likewise have place in
these Countries; as the last <i>Plague</i> in the City of <i>London</i> remarkably
proves, the Seeds of which, upon its first Entrance, and while it was
confined to a House or two, preserved themselves through a hard frosty
<i>Winter</i>, and again put forth their malignant Quality as soon as the
Warmth of the <i>Spring</i> gave them force: but, at the latter end of the
next Winter they were suppressed so as to appear no more, though in the
Month of <i>December</i> more than half the <i>Parishes</i> of the City were
infected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>A <i>corrupted State</i> of Air is, without doubt, necessary to give these
contagious Atoms their full force; for otherwise it were not easy to
conceive how the <i>Plague</i>, when once it had seized any Place, should
ever cease but with the Destruction of all the Inhabitants: Which is
readily accounted for by supposing an Emendation of the Qualities of the
<i>Air</i>, and the restoring of it to a healthful State capable of
dissipating and suppressing the Malignity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other hand, it does not appear, that the <i>Air</i>, however
corrupted, is usually capable of carrying Infection to a very great
distance; but that commonly the <i>Plague</i> is spread from Town to Town by
infected Persons and Goods: for there are numberless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> Instances, where
the <i>Plague</i> has caused a great Mortality in Towns, while other Towns
and Villages, very near them, have been entirely free. And hence it is,
that the <i>Plague</i> sometimes spreads from Place to Place very
irregularly. <i>Thuanus</i><span class="foot"><a name="f59.1" id="f59.1" href="#f59">[59]</a></span> speaks of a <i>Plague</i> in <i>Italy</i>, which one
Year was at <i>Trent</i> and <i>Verona</i>, the next got into <i>Venice</i> and
<i>Padua</i>, leaving <i>Vicenza</i>, an intermediate Place, untouched, though the
next Year that also felt the same Stroke: a certain Proof that the
<i>Plague</i> was not carried by the <i>Air</i> from <i>Verona</i> to <i>Padua</i> and
<i>Venice</i>; for the infected <i>Air</i> must have tainted all in its Passage.
We have had lately in <i>France</i> one Instance of the same Nature, when the
<i>Plague</i> was carried at once out of <i>Provence</i> several Leagues into the
<i>Gevaudan</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Usually indeed the <i>Plague</i>, especially when more violent
than ordinary, spreads from infected Places into those which border upon
them: which probably is sometimes effected by some little Communication
infected Towns are obliged to hold with the Country about them for the
sake of Necessaries, the Subtlety of the Venom now and then eluding the
greatest Precautions; and at other times by such as withdraw themselves
from infected Places into the Neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I own</span> it cannot be demonstrated, that when the <i>Plague</i> makes great
Ravage in any Town, the Number of Sick shall never be great enough to
load the <i>Air</i> with infectious <i>Effluvia</i>, emitted from them in such
Plenty, that they may be conveyed by the Winds into a neighbouring Town
or Village without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> dispersed so much as to hinder their producing
any ill Effects; especially since it is not unusual for the <i>Air</i> to be
so far charged with these noxious <i>Atoms</i>, as to leave no Place within
the infected Town secure: insomuch that when the Distemper is at its
Highth, all shall be indifferently infected, as well those who keep from
the Sick, as those who are near them; though at the beginning of a
<i>Plague</i> to avoid all Communication with the Diseased, is an effectual
Defence. However, I do not think this is often the Case: just as the
<i>Smoak</i>, with which the <i>Air</i> of the City of <i>London</i> is constantly
impregnated, especially in <i>Winter</i>, is not carried many Miles distant;
though the Quantity of it is vastly greater than the Quantity of
infectious <i>Effluvia</i>, that the most mortal <i>Plague</i> could generate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><span class="smcap">But</span>, to conclude what relates to the <i>Air</i>, since the ill Qualities of
it in these <i>Northern</i> Countries are not alone sufficient to excite the
<i>Plague</i>, without imported <i>Contagion</i>, this shews the Error of a common
Opinion, countenanc&#8217;d by Authors of great Name<span class="foot"><a name="f60.1" id="f60.1" href="#f60">[60]</a></span>, that we are
necessarily <i>visited</i> with the <i>Plague</i> once in thirty or forty Years:
which is a mere Fancy, without Foundation either in Reason or
Experience; and therefore People ought to be delivered from such vain
Fears. Since the <i>Pestilence</i> is never originally bred with us, but
always brought accidentally from abroad, its coming can have no relation
to any certain Period of Time. And although our three or four last
<i>Plagues</i> have fallen out nearly at such Intervals, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>yet that is much
too short a Compass of Years to be a Foundation for a general Rule.
Accordingly we see that almost fourscore Years have passed over without
any Calamity of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Air</i> of our Climate is so far from being ever the Original of the
true <i>Plague</i>, that most probably it never produces those milder
infectious Distempers, the <i>Small-Pox</i> and <i>Measles</i>. For these Diseases
were not heard of in <i>Europe</i> before the <i>Moors</i> had entered <i>Spain</i>:
and (as I have observed in the <i>Preface</i>) they were afterwards
propagated and spread through all Nations, chiefly by means of the Wars
with the <i>Saracens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, we are so far from any Necessity of these periodical Returns
of the <i>Plague</i>, that, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> contrary, though we have had several
Strokes of this kind, yet there are Instances of bad <i>Contagions</i> from
abroad being brought over to us, which have proved less malignant here,
when our <i>Northern Air</i> has not been disposed to receive such
Impressions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Sweating Sickness</i>, before hinted at, called <i>Sudor Anglicus</i> and
<i>Febris Ephemera Britannica</i>, because it was commonly thought to have
taken its Rise here, was most probably of a foreign Original: and though
not the common <i>Plague</i> with <i>Glandular Tumors</i>, and <i>Carbuncles</i>, yet a
real <i>Pestilence</i> from the same Cause, only altered in its Appearance,
and abated in its Violence, by the salutary Influence of our Climate.
For it preserved an Agreement with the common <i>Plague</i> in many of its
<i>Symptoms</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> <i>excessive Faintness</i> and <i>Inquietudes</i>, <i>inward
Burnings</i>, &amp;c. these <i>Symptoms</i> being no where observed in so intense a
Degree as here they are described to have been, except in the true
<i>Plague</i>: And, what is much more, it was likewise a <i>contagious</i>
Disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first time this was felt here, which was in the Year 1485, it began
in the Army, with which King <i>Henry</i> VII. came from <i>France</i> and landed
in <i>Wales</i><span class="foot"><a name="f61.1" id="f61.1" href="#f61">[61]</a></span>: and it has been supposed by some to have been brought
from the famous Siege of <i>Rhodes</i> by the <i>Turks</i> three or four Years
before, as may be collected from what Dr. <i>Keyes</i> says in one Place of
his Treatise on this Disease<span class="foot"><a name="f62.1" id="f62.1" href="#f62">[62]</a></span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Besides, of the several returns which
this has made since that time, <i>viz.</i> in the Years 1506, 1517, 1528, and
1551, that in the Year 1528 may very justly be suspected to have been
owing to the common <i>Pestilence</i>, which at those times raged in
<i>Italy</i><span class="foot"><a name="f63.1" id="f63.1" href="#f63">[63]</a></span> as I find one of our Historians has long ago
conjectured<span class="foot"><a name="f64.1" id="f64.1" href="#f64">[64]</a></span>: and the others were very probably from a <i>Turkish</i>
Infection. If at least some of these Returns were not owing to the
Remains of former Attacks, a suitable Constitution of Air returning to
put the latent Seeds in Action before they were quite destroyed. It is
the more probable that this Disease was owing to <i>imported Contagion</i>;
because we are assured, that this Form <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>of the Sickness was not peculiar
to our Island, but that it made great Destruction with the same Symptoms
in <i>Germany</i>, and other Countries<span class="foot"><a name="f65.1" id="f65.1" href="#f65">[65]</a></span>.</p>

<p>I call this Distemper a <i>Plague</i> with lessened Force: because though its
carrying off thousands for want of right Management was a Proof of its
Malignity, which indeed in one respect exceeded that of the common
<i>Plague</i> itself (for few, who were destroyed with it, survived the
Seizure above one Natural Day) yet its going off safely with <i>profuse
Sweats</i> in twenty four Hours, when due care was taken to promote that
Evacuation, shewed it to be what a learned and wise Historian calls it,
<i>rather a Surprize to Nature, than</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><i>obstinate</i> to <i>Remedies</i>; who
assigns this Reason for expressing himself thus, that <i>if the Patient
was kept warm with temperate Cordials, he commonly recovered</i><span class="foot"><a name="f66.1" id="f66.1" href="#f66">[66]</a></span>. And,
what I think yet more remarkable, <i>Sweating</i>, which was the natural
<i>Crisis</i> of this Distemper, has been found by great Physicians the best
Remedy against the common <i>Plague</i>: by which means, when timely used,
that Distemper may sometimes be carried off without any external
<i>Tumors</i>. Nay besides, a judicious Observer informs us, that in many of
his Patients, when he had broken the Violence of the Distemper by such
an artificial <i>Sweat</i>, a natural <i>Sweat</i> not excited by Medicines would
break forth exceedingly refreshing<span class="foot"><a name="f67.1" id="f67.1" href="#f67">[67]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span class="smcap">And</span> I cannot but take notice, as a Confirmation of what I have been
advancing, that we had here the same kind of Fever in the Year 1713,
about the Month of <i>September</i>, which was called the <i>Dunkirk Fever</i>, as
being brought by our Soldiers from that Place. This probably had its
Original from the <i>Plague</i>, which a few Years before broke out at
<i>Dantzick</i>, and continued some time among the Cities of the <i>North</i>.
With us this Fever began only with a Pain in the Head, and went off in
large <i>Sweats</i> usually after a Day&#8217;s Confinement: but at <i>Dunkirk</i> it
was attended with the additional Symptoms of <i>Vomiting</i>, <i>Diarrh&oelig;a</i>,
&amp;c.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> return from this Digression: From all that has been said, it appears,
I think, very plainly, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> the <i>Plague</i> is a real Poison, which being
bred in the Southern Parts of the World, is carried by Commerce into
other Countries, particularly into <i>Turky</i>, where it maintains itself by
a kind of Circulation from Persons to Goods: which is chiefly owing to
the Negligence of the People there, who are stupidly careless in this
affair. That when the Constitution of the <i>Air</i> happens to favour
<i>Infection</i>, it rages there with great Violence: that at that time more
especially diseased Persons give it to one another, and from them
<i>contagious Matter</i> is lodged in Goods of a loose and soft Texture,
which being pack&#8217;d up and carried into other Countries, let out, when
opened, the imprisoned Seeds of <i>Contagion</i>, and produce the Disease
whenever the <i>Air</i> is disposed to give them force; otherwise they may be
dissipated without any considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> ill Effects. And lastly, that the
<i>Air</i> does not usually diffuse and spread these to any great Distance,
if Intercourse and Commerce with the Place infected be strictly
prevented.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAP_I.2" id="CHAP_I.2"></a>CHAP. I.</h2>
<h3><i>Of preventing Infection from other Countries.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">As</span> it is a Satisfaction to know, that the <i>Plague</i> is not a Native of
our Country, so this is likewise an Encouragement to the utmost
Diligence in finding out Means to keep our selves clear from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Caution consists of two Parts: <i>The preventing its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> brought
into our Island</i>; and, if such a Calamity should happen, <i>the putting a
Stop to its spreading among us</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first of these is provided for by the established Method of obliging
Ships, that come from <i>infected</i> Places, to <i>perform Quarantaine</i>: As to
which, I think it necessary, that the following Rules be observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> to our several Ports, there should be <i>Lazaretto&#8217;s</i> built in
convenient Places, on little Islands, if it can so be, for the Reception
both of Men and Goods, which arrive from Places suspected of
<i>Infection</i>: The keeping Men in <i>Quarantaine</i> on board the Ship being
not sufficient; the only use of which is to observe whether any die
among them. For <i>Infection</i> may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> preserved so long in Clothes, in
which it is once lodged, that as much, nay more of it, if Sickness
continues in the Ship, may be brought on Shore at the end than at the
beginning of the forty Days: Unless a new <i>Quarantaine</i> be begun every
time any Person dies; which might not end, but with the Destruction of
the whole Ship&#8217;s Crew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> there has been any <i>contagious</i> Distemper in the Ship; the <i>sound</i>
Men should leave their Clothes, which should be sunk in the Sea, the Men
washed and shaved, and having fresh Clothes, should stay in the
<i>Lazaretto</i> thirty or forty Days. The reason of this is, because Persons
may be recovered from a Disease themselves, and yet retain <i>Matter</i> of
<i>Infection</i> about them a considerable time: as we frequently see the
<i>Small-Pox</i> taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> from those, who have several Days before passed
through the Distemper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Sick</i>, if there be any, should be kept in Houses remote from the
<i>Sound</i>, and, some time after they are well, should also be washed and
shaved, and have fresh Clothes; whatever they wore while sick being sunk
or buryed: And then being removed to the Houses of the <i>Sound</i>, should
continue there thirty or forty Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> particularly careful to destroy the <i>Clothes</i> of the Sick, because
they harbour the very <i>Quintessence</i> of <i>Contagion</i>. A very ingenious
Author<span class="foot"><a name="f68.1" id="f68.1" href="#f68">[68]</a></span>, in his admirable Description of the <i>Plague</i> at <i>Florence</i>
in the Year 1348, relates what himself <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>saw: That two <i>Hogs</i> finding in
the Streets the <i>Rags</i>, which had been thrown out from off a poor Man
dead of the Disease, after snuffling upon them, and tearing them with
their Teeth, they fell into Convulsions, and dy&#8217;d in less than an Hour.
The learned <i>Fracastorius</i> acquaints us, that in his time, there being a
<i>Plague</i> in <i>Verona</i>, no less than twenty five Persons were successively
kill&#8217;d by the Infection of one <i>Furr</i> Garment<span class="foot"><a name="f69.1" id="f69.1" href="#f69">[69]</a></span>. And <i>Forestus</i> gives
a like Instance of seven Children, who dy&#8217;d by playing upon Clothes
brought to <i>Alckmaer</i> in <i>North-Holland</i>, from an infected House in
<i>Zealand</i><span class="foot"><a name="f70.1" id="f70.1" href="#f70">[70]</a></span>. The late Mr. <i>Williams</i>, Chaplain to Sir <i>Robert Sutton</i>,
when Embassador at <i>Constantinople</i>, used to relate a Story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> of the same
Nature told him by a <i>Bassa</i>: that in an Expedition this <i>Bassa</i> made to
the Frontiers of <i>Poland</i>, one of the <i>Janizaries</i> under his Command
dy&#8217;d of the <i>Plague</i>; whose Jacket, a very rich one, being bought by
another <i>Janizary</i>, it was no sooner put on, but he also was taken sick
and dy&#8217;d: and the same Misfortune befel five <i>Janizaries</i> more, who
afterwards wore it. This the <i>Bassa</i> related to Mr. <i>Williams</i>, chiefly
for the sake of this farther Circumstance, that the Incidents now
mentioned prevailed upon him to order the burning of the Garment:
designing by this Instance to let Mr. <i>Williams</i> see there were <i>Turks</i>,
who allowed themselves in so much Freedom of Thought, as not to pay that
strict Regard to the <i>Mahometan</i> Doctrine of Fatality, as the Vulgar
among them do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> there has been no Sickness in the Ship, I see no reason why the Men
should perform <i>Quarantaine</i>. Instead of this, they may be washed, and
their Clothes aired in the <i>Lazaretto</i>, as Goods, for one Week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the greatest Danger is from such <i>Goods</i>, as are apt to retain
Infection, such as <i>Cotton</i>, <i>Hemp</i> and <i>Flax</i>, <i>Paper</i> or <i>Books</i>,
<i>Silk</i> of all sorts, <i>Linen</i>, <i>Wool</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Hair</i>, and all kinds
of <i>Skins</i>. The <i>Lazaretto</i> for these should be at a Distance from that
for the Men; and they must in convenient Warehouses be unpack&#8217;d, and
exposed, as much as may be, to the fresh Air for forty Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> may perhaps seem too long; but as we don&#8217;t know how much time
precisely is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> purge the Interstices of spongy Substances
from <i>infectious Matter</i> by fresh Air, the Caution cannot be too great
in this Point. Certainly the time here proposed, having been long
established by general Custom, ought not in the least to be retrenched;
unless there could be a way found out of trying when Bodies have ceased
to emit the noxious Fumes. Possibly this might be discovered by putting
tender <i>Animals</i> near to them, particularly little <i>Birds</i>: because it
has been observed in Times of the <i>Plague</i>, that the Country has been
forsaken by the <i>Birds</i>; and those kept in Houses have many of them
died<span class="foot"><a name="f71.1" id="f71.1" href="#f71">[71]</a></span>. Now if it should be found, that <i>Birds</i> let loose among Goods
at the beginning of their <i>Quarantaine</i>, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> obnoxious to the
<i>Contagion</i> in them, it may be known, in good measure, when such Goods
are become clean, by repeating the Trial till <i>Birds</i> let fly among them
receive no hurt. But the Use of this Expedient can be known only by
Experience. In the mean time, I own I am fond of the <i>Thought</i>, in
compassion to poor Labourers, who must expose their Lives to danger, in
the attendance upon this Work: and tho&#8217; I am well aware that there are
<i>Plagues</i> among Animals, which do not indifferently affect all kinds of
them, some being confined to a particular <i>Species</i>, (like the Disease
of the <i>Black Cattle</i> here, a few Years since, which neither proved
infectious to other Brutes, nor to Men;) yet it has always been observed
that the true <i>Plague</i> among Men has been destructive to all Creatures
of what kind soever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>A very remarkable Story, lately communicated to me by a Person of
undoubted Credit, is too much to the purpose to be here omitted. The
Fact is this. In the Year 1726, an English Ship took in Goods at <i>Grand
Cairo</i>, in the time of the <i>Plague&#8217;s</i> raging there, and carried them to
<i>Alexandria</i>. Upon opening one of the Bales of Wool in a Field, two
<i>Turks</i> employed in the Work were immediately killed: and some <i>Birds</i>,
which happened to fly over the Place, dropp&#8217;d down dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span>, the Use of <i>Quarantaines</i> is not wholly frustrated by our
Ignorance of the exact time required for this Purification: since the
<i>Quarantaine</i> does at least serve as a Trial whether Goods are infected
or not; it being hardly possible that every one of those, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
obliged to attend upon them, can escape hurt, if they are so. And
whenever that happens, the Goods must be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I take</span> it for granted, that the <i>Goods</i> should be <i>opened</i>, when they
are put into the <i>Lazaretto</i>, otherwise their being there will avail
nothing. This is the constant Practice in the <i>Ports</i> of <i>Italy</i>. That
it is so at <i>Leghorn</i>, appears by the Account lately published of the
Manner, in which <i>Quarantaines</i> are there performed: and I find, that
the same Rule is observed at <i>Venice</i>, from an authentic Paper, I have
before me, containing the Methods made use of in that City, where
<i>Quarantaines</i> have been enjoined ever since the Year 1484; at which
time, as far as I can learn, they were first instituted in <i>Europe</i>. In
that Place all <i>Bales</i> of <i>Cotton</i>, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> <i>Camel</i>&#8217;s or of <i>Beaver</i>&#8217;s
<i>Hair</i>, and the like, are <i>ript</i> open from end to end, and <i>Holes</i> made
in them by the <i>Porters</i> every Day, into which they thrust their naked
Arms, in order that the Air may have free Access to every part of the
Goods. That some such Cautions as these ought not to be omitted, is
clearly proved by the Misfortune, which happened in the Island of
<i>Bermudas</i> about the Year 1695; where, as the Account was given me by
the learned Dr. <i>Halley</i>, a Sack of <i>Cotton</i> put on Shore by Stealth,
lay above a Month without any Prejudice to the People of the House,
where it was hid: but when it came to be distributed among the
Inhabitants, it carried such a <i>Contagion</i> along with it, that the
Living scarce sufficed to bury the Dead. This Relation Dr. <i>Halley</i>
received from Captain <i>Tucker</i> of <i>Bermudas</i>, Brother to Mr. <i>Tucker</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
late Under-Secretary in our Secretary&#8217;s Office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed</span>, as it has been frequently experienced, that of all the Goods,
which harbour <i>Infection</i>, <i>Cotton</i> in particular is the most dangerous,
and <i>Turky</i> is almost a perpetual <i>Seminary</i> of the <i>Plague</i>; I cannot
but think it highly reasonable, that whatever <i>Cotton</i> is imported from
that part of the World, should at all Times be kept in <i><ins class="correction" title="original reads 'Qarantaine'">Quarantaine</ins></i>:
Because it may have imbibed <i>Infection</i> at the Time of its packing up,
notwithstanding no Mischief has been felt from it by the Ship&#8217;s Company.
And the length of Time from its being pack&#8217;d up to its Arrival here, is
no certain Security that it is cleared from the <i>Infection</i>. At least,
it is found, that the Time employed by Ships in passing between <i>Turky</i>
and <i>Marseilles</i>, is not long enough for Goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> to lose their
<i>Infection</i>: as appears not only from the late Instance, but also from
an Observation made in a certain <i>Memorial</i>, drawn up by the Deputy of
Trade at <i>Marseilles</i><span class="foot"><a name="f72.1" id="f72.1" href="#f72">[72]</a></span>. <i>Marseilles</i> is the only Port in <i>France</i>
allowed to receive Goods from the <i>Levant</i>, on Account of its singular
Convenience for <i>Quarantaines</i>, by Reason of several small <i>Islands</i>
situate about it. The <i>Ports</i> of <i>France</i> in the <i>Western Ocean</i> having
had a Desire to be allowed the same Liberty, their Deputies presented,
in the Year 1701, a <i>Memorial</i> to the <i>Royal Council of Trade</i>,
containing several Reasons for their Pretensions. To this the <i>Deputy</i>
at <i>Marseilles</i> makes Reply in the <i>Memorial</i> I am speaking of, in which
this Advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> of <i>Marseilles</i> for <i>Quarantaines</i> above the other
Ports, is much insisted upon: and, to evince the Importance thereof, it
is declared in express Words, that many Times Persons have been found in
that Place to die of the <i>Plague</i> in their Attendance upon Goods under
<i>Quarantaine</i>. Now if it be certain, that Goods have retained Infection
during their Passage from <i>Turkey</i> to <i>Marseilles</i>; it is too hardy a
Presumption to be admitted in an Affair so important as this, that they
must necessarily lose all Contagion in the Time of their coming to us,
because the Voyage is something longer. But besides this, there are some
few Instances of Goods, that have retained their Infection many Years.
In particular, <i>Alex. Benedictus</i> gives a very distinct Relation of a
Feather Bed, that was laid by seven Years on Suspicion of its being
infected, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> produced mischievous
Effects at <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'the the'">the</ins> End of that great
Length of Time<span class="foot"><a name="f73.1" id="f73.1" href="#f73">[73]</a></span>. And Sir <i>Theodore Mayerne</i> relates, that some
Clothes fouled with Blood and Matter from <i>Plague</i> Sores being lodged
between <i>Matting</i> and the Wall of a House in Paris, gave the <i>Plague</i>
several Years after to a Workman, who took them out, which presently
spread through the City<span class="foot"><a name="f74.1" id="f74.1" href="#f74">[74]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> makes <i>Cotton</i> so eminently dangerous, is its great Aptitude to
imbibe and retain any Sort of <i>Effluvia</i> near it; of which I have
formerly made a particular Experiment, by causing some <i>Cotton</i> to be
placed for one Day near a Piece <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>of <i>putrefying Flesh</i> from an amputated
Limb, in a Bell-Glass, but without touching it: for the <i>Cotton</i> imbibed
so strong a Taint, that being put up in a close Box, it retained its
offensive Scent above ten Months, and would, I believe, have kept it for
Years. If, instead of the Fumes of <i>putrefied Flesh</i> from a sound Body,
this <i>Cotton</i> had been thus impregnated with the Fumes of corrupted
Matter from one sick of the <i>Plague</i>; I make no doubt but it would have
communicated Infection. And the Experiment would have succeeded alike in
both Cases, if instead of <i>Cotton</i>, <i>Silk</i>, <i>Wool</i>, or <i>Hair</i> had been
inclosed in the Vessel: Animal Substances being the most apt to attract
the volatile Particles, which come from Bodies of the same Nature with
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span><span class="smcap">As</span> all reasonable Provisions should be made both for the <i>Sound</i> and
<i>Sick</i>, who perform <i>Quarantaine</i>; so the strict keeping of it ought to
be inforced by the severest <i>Penalties</i>. And if a Ship comes from any
Place, where the <i>Plague</i> raged, at the Time of the Ship&#8217;s Departure
from it, with more than usual Violence; it will be the securest Method
to <i>sink</i> all the <i>Goods</i>, and even the <i>Ship</i> sometimes: especially if
any on Board have died of the Disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nor</span> ought this farther Caution to be omitted, that when the <i>Contagion</i>
has ceased in any Place by the Approach of Winter, it will not be safe
to open a free Trade with <i>it</i> too soon: because there are Instances of
the <i>Distemper</i>&#8217;s being stopt by the Winter Cold, and yet the Seeds of
it not destroyed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> only kept unactive, &#8217;till the Warmth of the
following Spring has given them new Life and Force. Thus in the great
<i>Plague</i> at <i>Genoa</i> about four-score Years ago, which continued Part of
two Years; the first Summer about <i>ten Thousand</i> died; the Winter
following hardly any; but the Summer after no less than <i>sixty
Thousand</i>. Likewise the last <i>Plague</i> at <i>London</i> appeared the latter
End of the Year 1664, and was stopt during the Winter by a hard Frost of
near three Month&#8217;s Continuance; so that there remained no farther
Appearance of it &#8217;till the ensuing Spring<span class="foot"><a name="f75.1" id="f75.1" href="#f75">[75]</a></span>. Now if Goods brought from
such a Place should retain any of the latent <i>Contagion</i>, there will be
Danger of their producing the same Mischief in the Place, to which they
are brought, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>as they would have caused in that, from whence they came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> above all, it is necessary, that the <i>Clandestine Importing</i> of
Goods be punished with the utmost Rigour; from which wicked Practice I
should always apprehend more Danger of bringing the <i>Disease</i> than by
any other Way whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are, I think, the most material Points, to which Regard is to be
had in defending ourselves again <i>Contagion</i> from other Countries. The
particular Manner of putting these Directions in Execution, as the
<i>Visiting</i> of <i>Ships</i>, <i>Regulation</i> of <i>Lazaretto&#8217;s</i>, &amp;c. I leave to
proper Officers, who ought sometimes to be assisted herein by able
Physicians.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II.2" id="CHAP_II.2"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Stopping the Progress of the</i> Plague, <i>if it should enter our Country.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> next Consideration is, what to do in Case, through a Miscarriage in
the publick Care, by the Neglect of Officers, or otherwise, such a
Calamity should be suffered to befal us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no <i>Evil</i> in the World, in which the great Rule of <i>Resisting
the Beginning</i>, more properly takes Place, than in the present Case; and
yet it has unfortunately happened, that the common Steps formerly taken
have had a direct Tendency to hinder the putting <i>this Maxim</i> in
Practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the <i>Plague</i> always breaks out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> in some particular Place, it is
certain, that the Directions of the <i>Civil Magistrate</i> ought to be such,
as to make it as much for the Interest of infected Families to discover
their Misfortune, as it is, when a House is on <i>Fire</i>, to call in the
Assistance of the Neighbourhood: Whereas, on the contrary, the Methods
taken by the Publick, on such Occasions, have always had the Appearance
of a severe <i>Discipline</i>, and even <i>Punishment</i>, rather than of a
<i>Compassionate Care</i>; which must naturally make the <i>Infected</i> conceal
the Disease as long as was possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> main Import of the <i>Orders</i> issued out at these Times was<span class="foot"><a name="f76.1" id="f76.1" href="#f76">[76]</a></span>; As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>soon as it was found, that any House was infected, to keep it shut up,
with a <i>large red Cross</i>, and these Words, <i>Lord, have Mercy upon us</i>,
painted on the Door; Watchmen attending Day and Night to prevent any
one&#8217;s going in or out, except such <i>Physicians</i>, <i>Surgeons</i>,
<i>Apothecaries</i>, <i>Nurses</i>, <i>Searchers</i>, &amp;c. as were allowed by Authority:
And this to continue at least a Month after all the Family was <i>dead</i> or
<i>recovered</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not easy to conceive a more dismal Scene of Misery, than this:
Families lock&#8217;d up from all their Acquaintance, though seized with a
Distemper which the most of any in the World requires Comfort and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Assistance; abandoned it may be to the Treatment of an inhumane Nurse
(for such are often found at these times about the Sick;) and Strangers
to every thing but the melancholy Sight of the Progress, Death makes
among themselves: with small Hopes of Life left to the Survivers, and
those mixed with Anxiety and Doubt, whether it be not better to die,
than to prolong a miserable Being, after the Loss of their best Friends
and nearest Relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> <i>Fear</i>, <i>Despair</i>, and all <i>Dejection of Spirits</i>, dispose the Body
to receive <i>Contagion</i>, and give it a great Power, where it is received,
as all Physicians agree they do; I don&#8217;t see how a Disease can be more
inforced than by such a Treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> can justify such <i>Cruelty</i>, but the Plea, that it is for the
Good of the whole <i>Community</i>, and prevents the spreading of
<i>Infection</i>. But this upon due Consideration will be found quite
otherwise: For while <i>Contagion</i> is kept nursed up in a House, and
continually encreased by the daily Conquests it makes, it is impossible
but the <i>Air</i> should become tainted in so eminent a degree, as to spread
the <i>Infection</i> into the Neighbourhood upon the first Outlet. The
shutting up Houses in this Manner is only keeping so many <i>Seminaries</i>
of <i>Contagion</i>, sooner or later to be dispersed abroad: For the waiting
a Month, or longer, from the Death of the last Patient, will avail no
more, than keeping a <i>Bale</i> of infected <i>Goods</i> unpack&#8217;d; the Poyson
will fly out, whenever the <i>Pandora&#8217;s Box</i> is opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><span class="smcap">As</span> these Measures were owing to the Ignorance of the true Nature of
<i>Contagion</i>, so they did, I firmly believe, contribute very much to the
long Continuance of the <i>Plague</i>, every time they have been practised in
this City: And no doubt, they have had as ill Effects in other
Countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is therefore no wonder, that grievous Complaints were often made
against this unreasonable Usage; and that the Citizens were all along
under the greatest apprehensions of being thus <i>Shut up</i>. This
occasioned their concealing the Disease as long as they could, which
contributed very much to the inforcing and spreading of it: and when
they were confined, it often happened that they broke out of their

<i>Imprisonment</i>, either by getting out at Windows, <i>&amp;c.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> or by bribing
the Watchmen at their Doors; and sometimes even by murdering them. Hence
in the Nights, people were often met running about the Streets, with
hideous <i>Shrieks</i> of <i>Horror</i> and <i>Despair</i>, quite <i>Distracted</i>, either
from the violence of the Fever, or from the Terrors of Mind, into which
they were thrown by the daily Deaths they saw of their nearest
Relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these miserable Circumstances, many ran away, and when they had
escaped, either went to their Friends in the Country, or built Hutts or
Tents for themselves in the open Fields, or got on board Ships lying in
the River. A few also were saved by keeping their Houses close from all
communication with their Neighbours<span class="foot"><a name="f77.1" id="f77.1" href="#f77">[77]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><span class="smcap">And</span> it must be observed, that whenever popular Clamours prevailed so
far, as to procure some Release for the <i>Sick</i>, this was remarkably
followed with an Abatement of the Disease. The <i>Plague</i> in the Year 1636
began with great Violence; but leave being given by the King&#8217;s Authority
for People to quit their Houses, it was observed, That <i>not one in
twenty of the well Persons removed fell sick, nor one in ten of the Sick
died</i><span class="foot"><a name="f78.1" id="f78.1" href="#f78">[78]</a></span>. Which single Instance alone, had there been no other, should
have been of Weight ever after to have determined the Magistracy against
too strict Confinements. But besides this, a preceding <i>Plague</i>, <i>viz.</i>
in the Year 1625, affords us another Instance of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> remarkable
Decrease upon the discontinuing to <i>shut up</i> Houses. It was indeed so
late in the Year, before this was done, that the near Approach of Winter
was doubtless one Reason for the Diminution of the Disease, which
followed: Yet this was so very great, that it is at least past dispute,
that the Liberty then permitted was no Impediment to it. For this
<i>opening</i> of the Houses was allowed of in the beginning of <i>September</i>:
and whereas the last Week in <i>August</i>, there died no less than four
thousand two hundred and eighteen, the very next Week the <i>Burials</i> were
diminished to three thousand three hundred and forty four; and in no
longer time than to the fourth Week after, to eight hundred and fifty
two<span class="foot"><a name="f79.1" id="f79.1" href="#f79">[79]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span><span class="smcap">Since</span> therefore the Management in former Times neither answers the
Purpose of <i>discovering the Beginning</i> of the <i>Infection</i>, nor of
putting a stop to it when <i>discovered</i>, other Measures are certainly to
be taken; which, I think, should be of this Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> ought, in the first Place, <i>a Council of Health</i> to be
established, consisting of some of the principal Officers of State, both
Ecclesiastical and Civil, some of the chief Magistrates of the City, two
or three Physicians, <i>&amp;c.</i> And this <i>Council</i> should be intrusted with
such Powers, as might enable them to see all their Orders executed with
impartial Justice, and that no unnecessary Hardships, under any Pretence
whatever, be put upon any by the Officers they employ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of <i>ignorant old Women</i>, who are generally appointed <i>Searchers</i>
in Parishes to inquire what Diseases People die of, that <i>Office</i> should
be committed to <i>understanding and diligent Men</i>: whose Business it
should be, as soon as they find any have dy&#8217;d after an uncommon Manner,
particularly with <i>livid Spots</i>, <i>Bubo&#8217;s</i>, or <i>Carbuncles</i>, to give
Notice thereof to the <i>Council of Health</i>; who should immediately send
skilful Physicians to examine the suspected Bodies, and to visit the
Houses in the Neighbourhood, especially of the <i>poorer</i> Sort, among whom
this Evil generally begins. And if upon their Report it appears, that a
<i>Pestilential Distemper</i> is broken out, they should without Delay order
all the Families, in which the Sickness is, to be <i>removed</i>; the <i>Sick</i>
to different Places from the <i>Sound</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> but the Houses for both should be
three or four Miles out of Town; and the <i>Sound</i> People should be
<i>stript of all their Clothes</i>, and <i>washed</i> and <i>shaved</i>, before they go
into their new Lodgings. These Removals ought to be made in the Night,
when the Streets are clear of People: which will prevent all Danger of
spreading the Infection. And besides, all possible Care should be taken
to provide such Means of Conveyance for the <i>Sick</i>, that they may
receive no Injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this Management is necessary with Respect to the <i>Poor</i> and <i>meaner</i>
Sort of People; so the <i>Rich</i>, who have Conveniences, may, instead of
being carried to <i>Lazaretto&#8217;s</i>, be obliged to go to their
Country-Houses: provided that Care be always taken to keep the <i>Sound</i>
separated from the <i>Infected</i>. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> at the same Time all the Inhabitants
who are yet well, should be permitted, nay encouraged to leave the Town,
which, the thinner it is, will be the more healthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> manner of <i>Compassion</i> and <i>Care</i> should be wanting to the
<i>Diseased</i>; to whom, when lodged in <i>clean</i> and <i>airy</i> Habitations,
there would, with due Cautions, be no great Danger in giving Attendance.
All Expences should be paid by the Publick, and no Charges ought to be
thought great, which are counterbalanced with the saving a Nation from
the greatest of Calamities. Nor does it seem to me at all unreasonable,
that a <i>Reward</i> should be given to the Person, that makes the first
Discovery of <i>Infection</i> in any Place: since it is undeniable, that the
making known the <i>Evil</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> those, who are provided with proper Methods
against it, is the first and main Step towards the overcoming it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Methods taken in other Countries, as well as in our own,
have generally been different from what we have here recommended; yet
there are not wanting some Instances of extraordinary Success attending
these Measures, whenever they have happened to be put in Practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Magistrates of the City of <i>Ferrara</i> in <i>Italy</i> in the Year 1630,
when all the Country round about them was infected with the <i>Plague</i>,
observing the ill Success of the Conduct of their Neighbours, who, for
Fear of losing their Commerce, did all they could to conceal the
Disease, by keeping the Sick in their Houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> resolved, whenever
occasion should require, to take a different Method. Accordingly, as
soon as they received Information, that one had died in their City of
the <i>Pestilence</i>, they immediately removed the whole Family he belonged
to into a <i>Lazaretto</i>, where all, being seven in Number, likewise died.
But though the Disease was thus malignant, it went no farther, being
suppressed at once by this Method. Within the Space of a Year the same
Case returned seven or eight Times, and this Management as often put a
Stop to it. The Example of this <i>City</i> was afterwards followed more than
once by some other Towns in the same Territory with so good Success,
that it was thought expedient, for the common Good, to publish in the
<i>Memoirs</i> of the People of <i>Ferrara</i> this Declaration: <i>That the only
Remedy against the Plague is to make the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> early Discovery of it,
that is possible, and thus to extinguish it in the very Beginning</i><span class="foot"><a name="f80.1" id="f80.1" href="#f80">[80]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> less remarkable than this Occurrence at <i>Ferrara</i>, is what happened
at <i>Rome</i> in the <i>Plague</i>, I have taken Notice of before, in the Year
1657. When the Disease had spread itself among both Rich and Poor, and
raged in the most violent Manner; the <i>Pope</i> appointed Cardinal
<i>Gastaldi</i>, to be Commissary General of Health, giving him for a Time
the Power of the whole <i>Sacred College</i>, with full Commission to do
whatever he should judge necessary. Hereupon he gave strict Orders, that
no sick or suspected Persons should stay in their own Houses. The <i>Sick</i>
he removed, upon the first Notice, to a <i>Lazaretto</i> in the <i>Island</i> of
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><i>Tyber</i>; and all who were in the same Houses with them to other
<i>Hospitals</i> just without the City, in order to be sent to the <i>Island</i>,
if they should fall sick. At the same Time he took diligent Care to send
away their <i>Goods</i> to an airy Place to be cleansed. He executed these
Regulations with so much Strictness, that no Persons of the highest
Quality were exempted from this Treatment; which occasioned at first
great Complaints against the <i>Cardinal</i> for his Severity; but soon after
he had general Thanks: for in two Months Time, by this means, he
entirely cleared the City of the <i>Pestilence</i>, which had continued in it
almost two Years. And it was particularly observed, that whereas before,
when once the Disease had got into a House, it seldom ended without
seizing the whole Family; in this Management scarce five out of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
hundred of the sound Persons removed were infected<span class="foot"><a name="f81.1" id="f81.1" href="#f81">[81]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I cannot</span> but take Notice, that the <i>Plague</i> was stopp&#8217;d at <i>Marseilles</i>
a full Fortnight by the same Measures, and probably might have been
wholly extinguished, had not new Force been given it by the unseasonable
Confidence of the Inhabitants upon this Intermission: which, we are
informed, was so great, that they would not believe the <i>Pestilence</i> had
been at all among them, and publickly upbraided the Physicians and
Surgeons for frighting them causlesly<span class="foot"><a name="f82.1" id="f82.1" href="#f82">[82]</a></span>. At this Time, no doubt, they
must have neglected the Cautions necessary for their Security so much,
as to leave us no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>room to be surprized, that the Disease should after
this break out again with too great Violence to be a second Time
overcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, besides these Examples in foreign Countries, we have one Instance
of the same Nature nearer Home. When the <i>Plague</i> was last here in
<i>England</i>, upon its first Entrance into <i>Poole</i> in <i>Dorsetshire</i>, the
Magistrates immediately suppress&#8217;d it, by removing the <i>Sick</i> into
<i>Pest-Houses</i>, without the Town, as is well remember&#8217;d there to this
Time. A very remarkable Occurrence has greatly contributed towards
preserving all the Circumstances of this Transaction in Memory. They
found some Difficulty in procuring any one to attend upon the <i>Sick</i>
after their Removal: which obliged the Town to engage a <i>young Woman</i>,
then under Sentence of Death, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> that Service, on a Promise to use
their Interest for obtaining her Pardon. The young Woman escaped the
Disease, but neglecting to solicite the Corporation for the
Accomplishment of their Engagement with her, three or four Months after
she was barbarously hanged by the <i>Mayor</i> upon a Quarrel between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I would</span> have it here observed, that as the Advice I have been giving is
founded upon this Principle, that the best Method for stopping
Infection, is to separate the <i>Healthy</i> from the <i>Diseased</i>; so in small
Towns and Villages, where it is practicable, if the <i>Sound</i> remove
themselves into <i>Barracks</i>, or the like airy Habitations, it may
probably be even more useful, than to remove the <i>Sick</i>. This Method has
been found beneficial in <i>France</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> after all others have failed. But the
Success of this proves the Method of <i>Removing the Sick</i>, where this
other cannot be practised, to be the most proper of any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the <i>sick Families</i> are gone, all the Goods of the Houses, in which
they were, should be <i>buried</i> deep under Ground. This I prefer to
<i>burning</i> them: because, especially in a close Place, some infectious
Particles may possibly be dispersed by the Smoak through the
Neighbourhood; according to what <i>Mercurialis</i> relates, that the
<i>Plague</i> in <i>Venice</i> was augmented by burning a large Quantity of
infected Goods in the City<span class="foot"><a name="f83.1" id="f83.1" href="#f83">[83]</a></span>. A learned Physician of my Acquaintance
lately communicated to me the Relation of a Case, (given to him by an
Apothecary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> who was at the Place when the Thing happened) very proper
to be here mentioned. The Story is this. At <i>Shipston</i>, a little Town
upon the River <i>Stour</i> in <i>Worcestershire</i>, a poor Vagabond was seen
walking in the Streets with the <i>Small-Pox</i> upon him. The People
frightened took Care to have him carried to a little House, seated upon
a Hill, at some Distance from the Town, providing him with Necessaries.
In a few Days the Man died. They ordered him to be buried deep in the
Ground, and the House with his Cloaths to be burnt. The Wind, being
pretty high, blew the Smoak upon the Houses on one Side of the Town: In
that Part, a few Days after, eight Persons were seized with the
<i>Small-Pox</i>. So dangerous is <i>Heat</i> in all Kinds of pestilential
Distempers, and so diffusive of Contagion. And moreover the Houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
themselves may likewise be demolished or pulled down, if that can
conveniently be done; that is, if they are remote enough from others:
otherwise it may suffice to have them thoroughly cleansed, and then
plastered up. And after this, all possible Care ought still to be taken
to remove whatever Causes are found to breed and promote <i>Contagion</i>. In
order to this, the <i>Overseers</i> of the Poor (who might be assisted herein
by other Officers) should visit the Dwellings of all the meaner Sort of
the Inhabitants; and where they find them <i>stifled up too close</i> and
<i>nasty</i>, should lessen their Number by sending some into better
Lodgings, and should take Care, by all Manner of Provision and
Encouragement, to make them more <i>cleanly</i> and <i>sweet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> good Work carries its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> Reward with it so much as this kind of
<i>Charity</i>: and therefore, be the Expence what it will, it must never be
thought unreasonable. For nothing approaches so near to the first
Original of the <i>Plague</i>, as Air pent up, loaded with Damps, and
corrupted with the Filthiness, that proceeds from <i>Animal Bodies</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> <i>common Prisons</i> afford us an Instance of something like this, where
very few escape what they call the <i>Goal Fever</i>, which is always
attended with a Degree of <i>Malignity</i> in Proportion to the <i>Closeness</i>
and <i>Stench</i> of the Place: and it would certainly very well become the
Wisdom of the Government, as well with regard to the Health of the
<i>Town</i>, as in Compassion to the <i>Prisoners</i>, to take Care, that all
<i>Houses of Confinement</i> should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> kept as airy and clean, as is
consistent with the Use, to which they are designed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Black Assise</i> at <i>Oxford</i>, held in the Castle there in the Year
1577, will never be forgot<span class="foot"><a name="f84.1" id="f84.1" href="#f84">[84]</a></span>; at which the <i>Judges</i>, <i>Gentry</i>, and
almost all that were present, to the Number of three hundred, were
killed by a <i>poisonous Steam</i>, thought by some to have broken forth from
the <i>Earth</i>; but by a <i>noble</i> and <i>great</i> Philosopher<span class="foot"><a name="f85.1" id="f85.1" href="#f85">[85]</a></span> more justly
supposed to have been brought by the <i>Prisoners</i> out of the <i>Goal</i> into
<i>Court</i>; it being observed, that they alone were not injured by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the same Time, that this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Care is taken of <i>Houses</i>, the proper
Officers should be strictly charged to see that the <i>Streets</i> be washed
and kept clean from <i>Filth</i>, <i>Carrion</i>, and all manner of <i>Nusances</i>;
which should be carried away in the <i>Night Time</i>: nor should the
<i>Laystalls</i> be suffered to be too near the City. <i>Beggers</i> and <i>idle
Persons</i> should be taken up, and such miserable Objects, as are neither
fit for the common <i>Hospitals</i>, nor <i>Work-Houses</i>, should be provided
for in an <i>Hospital of Incurables</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orders</span> indeed of this Kind are necessary to be observed at all Times,
especially in populous Cities; and therefore I am sorry to take Notice,
that in these of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i> there is no good <i>Police</i>
established in these Respects: for want of which the Citizens and
Gentry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> are every Day annoyed more ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> these early <i>Precautions</i>, we have mentioned, prove successful, there
will be no need of any Methods for <i>Correcting the Air</i>, <i>Purifying
Houses</i>, or of <i>Rules for preserving particular Persons from Infection</i>:
to all which, if the <i>Plague</i> get head, so that the <i>Sick</i> are too many
to be removed (as they will be when the Disease has raged for a
considerable Time) Regard must be had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the <i>first</i>: <i>Fire</i> has been almost universally recommended for
this Purpose, both by the Ancients and Moderns; who have advised to make
frequent and numerous <i>Fires</i> in the Towns infected. This <i>Precept</i>, I
think, is almost entirely founded upon a Tradition, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> <i>Hippocrates</i>
put a stop to a <i>Plague</i> in <i>Greece</i> by this means. But it is to be
observed, that there is no mention made of any Thing like it in the
Works of <i>Hippocrates</i>. The best Authority we have for it, is the
Testimony of <i>Galen</i>, though it is also mentioned by other Authors.
<i>Galen</i>, recommending <i>Theriaca</i> against the <i>Pestilence</i>, has thought
fit, it seems, to compare it to <i>Fire</i>; and, upon this Conceit, relates,
that <i>Hippocrates</i> cured a <i>Plague</i>, which came from <i>&AElig;thiopia</i> into
<i>Greece</i>, by purifying the Air with <i>Fires</i>; into which were thrown
sweet-scented Herbs, and Flowers, together with Ointments of the finest
Flavour. It is remarkable, that among the <i>Epistles</i> ascribed to
<i>Hippocrates</i>, which, though not genuine, yet are older than <i>Galen</i>,
there is a <i>Decree</i> said to be made by the <i>Athenians</i> in Honour of this
Father of Physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> which, making mention of the Service he had done
his Country in a <i>Plague</i>, says only, that he sent his Scholars into
several Parts, with proper Instructions to cure the Disease. By which it
should seem, that this Story of the <i>Fires</i> was hardly or not at all
known at the Time, when these <i>Letters</i> were compiled. And <i>Soranus</i> may
yet more confirm us, that it was framed long after the Death of
<i>Hippocrates</i>: for <i>Soranus</i> only says in general, that <i>Hippocrates</i>
foretold the coming of the <i>Pestilence</i>, and took care of the Cities of
<i>Greece</i>; without any mention of having used this particular Expedient.
<i>Plutarch</i> indeed speaks of a Practice like this as commonly approved
among Physicians, which he makes use of to illustrate a certain Custom
of the <i>Egyptians</i>: of whom he says, that they <i>purify</i> the Air by the
Fumes of <i>Resin</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> <i>Myrrh</i>, as Physicians correct the Foulness, and
attenuate the Thickness thereof in Times of <i>Pestilence</i>, by <i>burning
Sweet-Woods</i>, <i>Juniper</i>, <i>Cypress</i><span class="foot"><a name="f86.1" id="f86.1" href="#f86">[86]</a></span> &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> I take to be the Sum of what can be learned from Antiquity in
Relation to this Point; from whence we may see, that Writers have
concluded a little too hastily for the use of <i>common Fires</i> in this
Case, upon the Authority and Example of <i>Hippocrates</i>, though we should
allow the Fact as related by <i>Galen</i>: when it will not from thence
appear that <i>Hippocrates</i> himself relied upon them; since he thought it
necessary to take in the Assistance of <i>aromatic Fumes</i>. But as this
Fact is not grounded upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>sufficient Authority, so it is needless to
insist long upon it. The Passage I have brought from <i>Plutarch</i> will
better explain what was the Sentiment of those Physicians who approved
the Practice. It seems they expected from thence to dispel the Thickness
and Foulness of the Air. And no doubt but such evil Dispositions of the
Air, as proceed from <i>Damps</i>, <i>Exhalations</i>, and the like, may be
corrected even by <i>common Fires</i>, and the Predisposition of it from
these Causes to receive Infection sometimes removed. But I think this
Method, if it be necessary, should be put in Practice before the coming
of the <i>Pestilence</i>. For when the Distemper is actually <i>begun</i>, and
rages, since it is known to <i>spread</i> and <i>increased</i> by the <i>Heat</i> of
the <i>Summer</i>, and on the contrary checked by the <i>Cold</i> in <i>Winter</i>;
undoubtedly, whatever increases that <i>Heat</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> will so far add Force to
the Disease: as <i>Mercurialis</i> takes notice, that <i>Smiths</i>, and all those
who worked at the <i>Fire</i> were most severely used in the <i>Plague</i> at
<i>Venice</i> in his Time<span class="foot"><a name="f87.1" id="f87.1" href="#f87">[87]</a></span>. Whether the Service <i>Fires</i> may do by
correcting any other ill Qualities of the Air, will counterbalance the
Inconvenience upon this Account, Experience only can determine: and the
fatal Success of the Trials made here in the last <i>Plague</i>, is more than
sufficient to discourage any farther Attempts of this Nature. For
<i>Fires</i> being ordered in all the <i>Streets</i> for three Days together,
there died in one Night following no less than four thousand (if we may
believe Dr. <i>Hodges</i>:) whereas in any single Week before or after, never
twice that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Number were carried
off<span class="foot"><a name="f88.1" id="f88.1" href="#f88">[88]</a></span>. And we find that upon making
the same Experiment in the last <i>Plague</i> at <i>Marseilles</i>, the Contagion
was every Day spread more and more thro&#8217; the City with increas&#8217;d Rage
and Violence<span class="foot"><a name="f89.1" id="f89.1" href="#f89">[89]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> has been said of <i>Fires</i>, is likewise to be understood of <i>Firing
of Guns</i>, which some have too rashly advised. The proper Correction of
the Air would be to make it <i>fresh</i> and <i>cool</i>: Accordingly the
<i>Arabians</i><span class="foot"><a name="f90.1" id="f90.1" href="#f90">[90]</a></span>, who were best acquainted with the Nature of
<i>Pestilences</i>, advise People to keep themselves as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><i>airy</i> as possible,
and to chuse Dwellings exposed to the Wind, situate high, and refreshed
with running Waters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for <i>Houses</i>, the first Care ought to be to keep them <i>clean</i>: for as
<i>Nastiness</i> is a great Source of <i>Infection</i>, so <i>Cleanliness</i> is the
greatest Preservative; which shews us the true Reason, why the <i>Poor</i>
are most obnoxious to <i>Contagious Diseases</i>. It is remarked of the
<i>Persians</i>, that though their Country is surrounded every Year with the
<i>Plague</i>, they seldom or never suffer any Thing by it themselves: and it
is likewise known, that they are the most <i>cleanly</i> People of any in the
World, and that many among them make it a great Part of their Religion
to remove <i>Filthiness</i> and <i>Nusances</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> every Kind from all Places
about their Cities and Dwellings<span class="foot"><a name="f91.1" id="f91.1" href="#f91">[91]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> this, the <i>Arabians</i> advise the keeping Houses <i>cool</i>, as
another Method of their <i>Purification</i>, and therefore, to answer this
End more fully, they directed to strew them with <i>cooling</i> Herbs, as
<i>Roses</i>, <i>Violets</i>, <i>Water-Lilies</i>, &amp;c. and to be washed with <i>Water</i>
and <i>Vinegar</i>: than all which, especially the last, nothing more proper
can be proposed. I think it not improper likewise to <i>fume</i> Houses with
<i>Vinegar</i>, either alone or together with <i>Nitre</i>, by throwing it upon a
<i>hot Iron</i> or <i>Tile</i>; though this be directly contrary to what modern
Authors mostly advise, which is to make Fumes with hot things, as
<i>Benzoin</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><i>Frankincense</i>, <i>Storax</i>, &amp;c. from which I see no reason to
expect any Virtue to destroy the Matter of <i>Infection</i>, or to keep
particular Places from a Disposition to receive it; which are the only
things here to be aimed at. The <i>Smoak</i> of <i>Sulphur</i>, perhaps, as it
abounds with an <i>acid Spirit</i>, which is found by Experience to be very
<i>penetrating</i>, and to have a great Power to repress <i>Fermentations</i>, may
promise some Service this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> hot Fumes appear to be generally <i>useless</i>, so the Steams of
<i>Poisonous Minerals</i> ought to be reckoned <i>dangerous</i>: and therefore I
cannot but dissuade the use of all <i>Fumigations</i> with <i>Mercury</i> or
<i>Arsenic</i>. Much less would I advise, as some have done, the wearing
<i>Arsenic</i> upon the <i>Pit</i> of the <i>Stomach</i> as an <i>Amulet</i>: since this
Practice has been often attended with very ill Consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and is not
grounded upon any good Authority, but probably derived from an Error in
mistaking the <i>Arabian</i> Word <i>Darsini</i>, which signifies <i>Cinnamon</i>, for
the <i>Latin de Arsenico</i>, as I have formerly shewn<span class="foot"><a name="f92.1" id="f92.1" href="#f92">[92]</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next thing after the <i>Purifying of Houses</i>, is to consider by what
Means particular <i>Persons</i> may best defend themselves against
<i>Contagion</i>: for the certain doing of which, it would be necessary to
put the <i>Humours</i> of the <i>Body</i> into such a State, as not to be
alterable by the <i>Matter of Infection</i>. But since this is no more to be
hoped for, than a <i>Specific Preservative</i> from the <i>Small-Pox</i>; the most
that can be done, will be to keep the Body in such Order, that it may
suffer as little as possible. The <i>first Step</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> towards which, is to
maintain a good State of Health, in which we are always least liable to
suffer by any external Injuries; and not to weaken the Body by
Evacuations. The <i>next</i> is, to guard against all <i>Dejection of Spirits</i>,
and <i>immoderate Passions</i>: for these we daily observe do expose Persons
to the more common <i>Contagion</i> of the <i>Small-Pox</i>. These Ends will be
best answered by living with Temperance upon a good generous Diet, and
by avoiding <i>Fastings</i>, <i>Watchings</i>, <i>extreme Weariness</i>, &amp;c. <i>Another</i>
Defence is, to use whatever Means are proper to keep the <i>Blood</i> from
<i>Inflaming</i>. This, if it does not secure from <i>contracting Infection</i>,
will at least make the <i>Effects</i> of it less violent. The most proper
Means for this, according to the Advice of the <i>Arabian</i> Physicians, is
the repeated Use of <i>acid Fruits</i>, as <i>Pomegranates</i>, <i>Sevil Oranges</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<i>Lemons</i>, <i>Tart Apples</i>, &amp;c. But above all, of <i>Wine Vinegar</i> in small
Quantities, rendered grateful to the Stomach by the Infusion of some
such Ingredients as <i>Gentian Root</i>, <i>Galangal</i>, <i>Zedoary</i>, <i>Juniper
Berries</i>, &amp;c. Which Medicines by correcting the <i>Vinegar</i>, and taking
off some ill Effects it might otherwise have upon the Stomach, will be
of good Use: but these, and all other hot <i>aromatic</i> Drugs, though much
recommended by Authors, if used alone, are most likely to do hurt by
<i>over-heating</i> the Blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I cannot</span> but recommend likewise the Use of <i>Issues</i>. The properest Place
for them I take to be the inside of the Thigh a little above the Knee.
Besides, the smoaking <i>Tobacco</i>, much applauded by some, since it may be
put in Practice without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> any great Inconvenience, need not, I think, be
neglected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> since none of these Methods promise any certain Protection; as
<i>leaving</i> the Place infected is the surest <i>Preservative</i>, so the next
to it is to avoid, as much as may be, the <i>near Approach</i> to the <i>Sick</i>,
or to such as have but <i>lately recovered</i>. For the greater Security
herein, it will be adviseable to avoid all <i>Crouds of People</i>. Nay, it
should be the Care of the <i>Magistrate</i> to prohibit all unnecessary
<i>Assemblies</i>: and likewise to oblige all, who get over the Disease, to
<i>confine</i> themselves for some time, before they appear abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Advice to keep at a Distance from the <i>Sick</i>, is also to be
understood of the <i>Dead Bodies</i>; which should be <i>buried</i> at as great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> a
Distance from Dwelling-Houses, as may be; put <i>deep</i> in the Earth; and
<i>covered</i> with the exactest Care; but not with <i>Quick-Lime</i> thrown in
with them, as has been the Manner abroad: For I cannot but think that
<i>This</i>, by <i>Fermenting</i> with the putrefying Humours of the Carcases, may
give rise to noxious Exhalations from the Ground. They should likewise
be <i>carried out</i> in the <i>Night</i>, while they are yet fresh and free from
<i>Putrefaction</i>: Because a Carcase not yet beginning to corrupt, if kept
from the Heat of the Day, hardly emits any kind of Steam or Vapour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for those, who must of necessity attend the <i>Sick</i>; some farther
Directions should be added for their Use. These may be comprehended in
two short Precepts. <i>One</i> is, not to <i>swallow their Spittle</i> while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> they
are about the <i>Sick</i>, but rather to <i>spit</i> it out: <i>The other</i>, not so
much as to <i>draw in their Breath</i>, when they are very near them. The
reason for both these appears from what has been said above concerning
the Manner, in which a sound Person receives the Infection. But in case
it be too difficult constantly to comply with these <i>Cautions</i>,
<i>washing</i> the <i>Mouth</i> frequently with <i>Vinegar</i>, and <i>holding</i> to the
<i>Nostrils</i> a <i>Sponge</i> wet with the same, may in some measure supply
their Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the Sum of what I think most likely to stop the Progress of the
<i>Disease</i> in any Place, where it shall have got Admittance. If some few
of these Rules refer more particularly to the City of <i>London</i>, with
small Alteration they may be applied to any other <i>Place</i>. It now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>remains therefore only to lay down some Directions to hinder the
Distemper&#8217;s spreading from <i>Town</i> to <i>Town</i>. The best Method for which,
where it can be done, (for this is not practicable in very great Cities)
is to cast up a <i>Line</i> about the <i>Town infected</i>, at a convenient
Distance; and by placing a <i>Guard</i>, to hinder People&#8217;s passing from it
without due Regulation, to other Towns: but not absolutely to forbid any
to withdraw themselves, as was done in <i>France</i>, according to the usual
Practice abroad; which is an unnecessary Severity, not to call it a
Cruelty. I think it will be enough, if all, who desire to pass the
<i>Line</i>, be permitted to do it, upon Condition they first perform
<i>Quarantaine</i> for about twenty Days in <i>Tents</i>, or other more convenient
<i>Habitations</i>. But the greatest care must be taken, that none pass
without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> conforming themselves to this Order; both by keeping diligent
<i>Watch</i>, and by <i>punishing</i>, with the utmost Severity, any that shall
either have done so, or attempt it. And the better to discover <i>such</i>,
it will be requisite to oblige all, who travel in any Part of the
Country, under the same Penalties, to carry with them <i>Certificates</i>
either of their coming from Places not <i>infected</i>, or of their passing
the <i>Line</i> by Permission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> I take to be a more effectual Method to keep the <i>Infection</i> from
spreading, than the absolute refusing a Passage to People upon any
Terms. For when Men are in such imminent Danger of their Lives where
they are, many, no doubt, if not otherwise allowed to escape, will use
Endeavours to do it secretly, let the Hazard be ever so great. And it
can hardly be, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> some will succeed in their Attempts; as we see it
has often happen&#8217;d in <i>France</i>, notwithstanding all their Care. But one
that gets off thus clandestinely, will be more likely to carry the
Distemper with him, than twenty, nay a hundred, that go away under the
preceding Restrictions: especially because the <i>Infection</i> of the Place,
he flies from, will by this Management be rendered much more intense.
For confining People, and shutting them up together in great Numbers,
will make the Distemper rage with augmented Force, even to the
increasing it beyond what can be easily imagined: as appears from the
Account which the learned <i>Gassendus</i><span class="foot"><a name="f93.1" id="f93.1" href="#f93">[93]</a></span> has given us of a memorable
<i>Plague</i>, which happened at <i>Digne</i> in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><i>Provence</i>, where he lived, in
the Year 1629. This was so terrible, that in one <i>Summer</i>, out of <i>ten
thousand</i> Inhabitants, it left but <i>fifteen hundred</i>, and of them all
but <i>five</i> or <i>six</i> had gone through the <i>Disease</i>. And he assigns
<i>this</i>, as the principal Cause of the great Destruction, that the
Citizens were too closely confined, and not suffered so much as to go to
their Country-Houses. Whereas in another <i>Pestilence</i>, which broke out
in the same Place a Year and an half after, more Liberty being allowed,
there did not die above <i>one hundred</i> Persons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> these Reasons, I think, to allow People with proper <i>Cautions</i> to
remove from an infected Place, is the best Means to suppress the
<i>Contagion</i>, as well as the most humane Treatment of the present
Sufferers: and, under these Limitations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> the Method of <i>investing</i>
Towns infected, which is certainly the most proper, that can be advised,
to keep the Disease from spreading, will be no Inconvenience to the
Places <i>surrounded</i>. On the contrary, it will rather be useful to them;
since the Guard may establish such <i>Regulations</i> for the Safety of
those, who shall bring Provisions, as shall remove the Fears, which
might otherwise discourage them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> securing against all Apprehensions of this Kind, is of so great
Importance, that in <i>Cities</i> too large to be invested, as, for Example,
this City of <i>London</i>, the <i>Magistrates</i> must use all possible Diligence
to supply this Defect, not only by setting up <i>Barriers</i> without their
City, but by making it in the most particular manner their Care to
appoint such <i>Orders</i> to be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> at them, as they shall judge will
be most satisfactory to the Country about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Liberty ought to be given to the <i>People</i>, yet no sort of <i>Goods</i>
must by any means be suffered to be carried over the <i>Line</i>, which are
made of <i>Materials</i> retentive of <i>Infection</i>. For in the present Case,
when <i>Infection</i> has seized any Part of a Country, much greater Care
ought to be taken, that no <i>Seeds</i> of the <i>Contagion</i> be conveyed about,
than when the Distemper is at a great Distance: because a <i>Bale of
Goods</i>, which shall have imbibed the <i>Contagious Aura</i> when pack&#8217;d up in
<i>Turky</i>, or any remote Parts, when unpack&#8217;d here, may chance to meet
with so healthful a Temperament of our Air, that it shall not do much
hurt. But when the Air of any one of our Towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> shall be so corrupted,
as to maintain and spread the <i>Pestilence</i> in it, there will be little
Reason to believe, that the Air of the rest of the Country is in a much
better State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the same Reason <i>Quarantaines</i> should more strictly be enjoined,
when the <i>Plague</i> is in a bordering Kingdom, than when it is more
remote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Advice here given with respect to <i>Goods</i>, is not only abundantly
confirmed from the Proofs, I have given above, that <i>Goods</i> have a Power
of spreading <i>Contagion</i> to distant Places; but might be farther
illustrated by many Instances of ill Effects from the Neglect of this
Caution in Times of the <i>Plague</i>. I shall mention two, which happen&#8217;d
among us during the last <i>Plague</i>. I have had occasion already to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>observe, that the <i>Plague</i> was in <i>Poole</i>. It was carried to that Place
by some <i>Goods</i> contained in a <i>Pedlar&#8217;s Pack</i>. The <i>Plague</i> was
likewise at <i>Eham</i> in the Peak of <i>Derbyshire</i>, being brought thither by
means of a Box sent from <i>London</i> to a Taylor in that Village,
containing some Materials relating to his Trade. There being several
Incidents in this latter Instance, that will not only serve to establish
in particular the Precepts I have been giving, in relation to Goods, but
likewise all the rest of the Directions, that have been set down, for
stopping the Progress of the <i>Plague</i> from one Town to another; I shall
finish this Chapter with a particular Relation of what passed in that
Place. A Servant, who first opened the foresaid <i>Box</i>, complaining that
the Goods were damp, was ordered to dry them at the Fire; but in doing
it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> was seized with the <i>Plague</i>, and died: the same Misfortune
extended itself to all the rest of the Family, except the Taylor&#8217;s Wife,
who alone survived. From hence the Distemper spread about and destroyed
in that Village, and the rest of the Parish, though a small one, between
two and three hundred Persons. But notwithstanding this so great
Violence of the Disease, it was restrained from reaching beyond that
Parish by the Care of the Rector; from whose Son, and another worthy
Gentleman, I have the Relation. This Clergyman advised, that the <i>Sick</i>
should be removed into <i>Hutts</i> or <i>Barracks</i> built upon the <i>Common</i>;
and procuring by the Interest of the then Earl of <i>Devonshire</i>, that the
People should be well furnished with Provisions, he took effectual Care,
that no one should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> go out of the Parish: and by this means he protected
his Neighbours from Infection with compleat Success.</p>

<p>I have now gone through the chief Branches of <i>Preservation</i> against the
<i>Plague</i>, and shall conclude with some general Directions concerning the <i>Cure</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III"></a>CHAP. III.</h2>
<h3><i>Of the Cure of the Plague.</i></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">It</span> appears, from what has been said in the beginning of this Discourse,
that the <i>Plague</i> and the <i>Small-Pox</i> are Diseases, which bear a great
Similitude to each other: both being <i>Contagious Fevers</i> from <i>Africa</i>,
and both attended with certain <i>Eruptions</i>. And as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> <i>Eruptions</i> or
<i>Pustules</i> in the <i>Small-Pox</i> are of two Kinds, which has caused the
Distemper to be divided into two Species, the <i>distinct</i> and
<i>confluent</i>; so we have shewn two Sorts of <i>Eruptions</i> or <i>Tumors</i>
likewise to attend the <i>Plague</i>. In the first and mildest Kind of the
<i>Small-Pox</i> the <i>Pustules</i> rise high above the Surface of the Skin, and
contain a digested <i>Pus</i>; but in the other, the <i>Pustules</i> lie flat, and
are filled with an indigested <i>Sanies</i>. The two kinds of critical
<i>Tumors</i> in the <i>Plague</i> are yet more different. In the most favourable
Case the <i>Morbific Matter</i> is thrown upon some of the softest <i>Glands</i>
near the Surface of the Body, as upon the <i>inguinal</i>, <i>axillary</i>,
<i>parotid</i>, or <i>maxillary</i> Glands: the first Appearance of which is a
small Induration, great Heat, Redness, and sharp Pain near those Glands.
These <i>Tumors</i>, if the Patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> recover, like the <i>Pustules</i> of the
distinct <i>Small-Pox</i>, come to a just Suppuration, and thereby discharge
the Disease. In worse Cases of the Distemper, either instead of these
<i>Tumors</i>, or together with them, <i>Carbuncles</i> are raised. The first
Appearance of them is a very small indurated <i>Tumor</i>, not situate near
any of the fore-mention&#8217;d Glands, with a dusky Redness, violent Heat,
vast Pain, and a blackish <i>Spot</i> in the middle of the <i>Tumor</i>. This
<i>Spot</i> is the beginning of a <i>Gangrene</i>, which spreads itself more and
more as the <i>Tumor</i> increases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, besides the Agreement in these critical Discharges, the two
Distempers have yet a more manifest Likeness in those <i>livid</i> and <i>black
Spots</i>, which are frequent in the <i>Plague</i>, and the Signs of speedy
Death: for the same are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> found to attend the <i>Small-Pox</i> with
as fatal a Consequence; nay, I have seen Cases, when almost every
<i>Pustule</i> has taken this Appearance. Moreover, in both Diseases, when
eminently malignant, Blood is sometimes voided by the Mouth, by Urine,
or the like<span class="foot"><a name="f94.1" id="f94.1" href="#f94">[94]</a></span>. And we may farther add, that in both Death is usually
caused by Mortifications in the <i>Viscera</i>. This has constantly been
found in the <i>Plague</i> by the Physicians in <i>France</i>: and I am convinced,
from Accounts I have by me, of the Dissection of a great many, who had
died of the <i>Small-Pox</i>, that it is the same in that Distemper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Analogy between the two <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Diseases, not only shews us, that we
cannot expect to cure the <i>Plague</i> any more than the <i>Small-Pox</i>, by
<i>Antidotes</i> and <i>Specific Medicines</i>; but will likewise direct us in the
Cure of the Distemper, with which we are less acquainted, by the Methods
found useful in the other Disease, which is more familiar to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> short, as in the <i>Small-Pox</i>, the chief Part of the Management
consists in clearing the <i>Prim&aelig; Vi&aelig;</i> in the beginning; in regulating the
Fever; and in promoting the natural Discharges: so in the <i>Plague</i> the
same Indications will have Place. The great Difference lies in this,
that in the <i>Plague</i> the Fever is often much more acute than in the
other Distemper; the Stomach and Bowels are sometimes inflamed; and the
Eruptions require external Applications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> which to the <i>Pustules</i> of the
<i>Small-Pox</i> are not necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Fever is very acute, a cool <i>Regimen</i>, commonly so beneficial
in the <i>Small-Pox</i>, is here still more necessary. But whenever the Pulse
is languid, and the Heat not excessive, moderate Cordials must be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Disposition of the Stomach and Bowels to be inflamed, makes
<i>Vomiting</i> not so generally safe in the <i>Plague</i> as in the <i>Small-Pox</i>.
The most gentle <i>Emetics</i> ought to be used, none better than
<i>Ipecacuanha</i>; and great Caution must be had, that the Stomach or Bowels
are not inflamed, when they are administer&#8217;d: for if they are, nothing
but certain Death can be expected from them: otherwise at the beginning
they will be always useful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> Therefore upon the first Illness of the
Patient it must carefully be considered, whether there appear any
Symptoms of an Inflammation having seized these Parts: if there are any
Marks of this, all <i>Vomits</i> must be omitted; if not, the Stomach ought
to be gently moved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Eruptions</i>, whether <i>glandular Tumors</i>, or <i>Carbuncles</i>, must not
be left to the Course of Nature, as is done in the <i>Small-Pox</i>; but all
Diligence must be used, by external Applications, to bring them to
<i>Suppurate</i>. Both these <i>Tumors</i> are to be treated in most respects
alike. As soon as either of them appears, fix a <i>Cupping-Glass</i> to it
without <i>scarifying</i>; and when that is removed, apply a <i>suppurative
Cataplasm</i>, or <i>Plaster</i> of warm Gums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><span class="smcap">If</span> the <i>Tumors</i> do
not come to <i>Suppuration</i>, which the <i>Carbuncle</i>
seldom or never does; but if a thin <i>Ichor</i> or Matter exudes through the
Pores; or if the <i>Tumor</i> feel soft to the Touch; or lastly, if it has a
black <i>Crust</i> upon it, then it must be <i>opened</i> by <i>Incision</i>, either
according to the length of the <i>Tumor</i>, or by a <i>crucial Section</i>. And
if there is any Part <i>mortified</i>, as is usually in the <i>Carbuncle</i>, it
must be <i>scarified</i>. This being done, it will be necessary to stop the
Bleeding, and dry up the <i>Moisture</i> with an <i>actual Cautery</i>, dressing
the Wound afterwards with <i>Dossils</i>, and <i>Pledgits</i> spread with the
common <i>Digestive</i> made with <i>Terebinth. cum Vitel. Ov.</i> and dip&#8217;d in a
Mixture of two Parts of warmed Oil of <i>Turpentine</i>, and one Part of <i>Sp.
Sal. Ammon.</i> or in <i>Bals.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> <i>Terebinth.</i> and over all must be put a
<i>Cataplasm of Theriac. Lond.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Day the Wound ought to be well <i>bathed</i> with a <i>Fomentation</i>
made of warm <i>aromatic</i> Plants with Spirit of Wine in it; in order, if
possible, to make the Wound digest, by which the <i>Sloughs</i> will
separate. After this the <i>Ulcer</i> may be treated as one from an ordinary
<i>Abscess</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farther</span>, in the <i>glandular Tumors</i>, when they suppurate, we ought not to
wait, till the <i>Matter</i> has made its way to the outer Skin, but to open
it as soon as it is risen to any Bigness: because these <i>Tumors</i> begin
deep in the Gland, and often mortify, before the Suppuration has reached
the Skin, as the Physicians in <i>France</i> have found upon dissecting many
dead Bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><span class="smcap">This</span> is the Method in which the <i>Plague</i> must be treated in following
the natural Course of the Distemper. But the Patient in most Cases runs
so great Hazard in this way, notwithstanding the utmost Care, that it
would be of the greatest Service to Mankind under this Calamity, if some
artificial Discharge for the corrupted Humours could be found out, not
liable to so great Hazard, as the natural Way. To this Purpose <i>large
Bleeding</i> and <i>profuse Sweating</i> are recommended to us upon some
Experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> <i>Sydenham</i> tried both these Evacuations with good Success, and has
made two very judicious Remarks upon them. The <i>first</i> is, that they
ought not to be attempted unless in the Beginning of the Sickness,
before the natural Course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> of the Distemper has long taken Place:
because otherwise we can only expect to put all into Confusion without
any Advantage. His <i>other</i> Observation is, that we cannot expect any
prosperous Event from either of these Evacuations, unless they are very
copious: there being no Prospect of surmounting so violent a Malignity
without bolder Methods than must be taken in ordinary Cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for <i>Bleeding</i>, by some Accounts from <i>France</i>, I have been informed,
that some of the Physicians there have carried this Practice so far, as
upon the first Day of the Distemper to begin with bleeding about twelve
Ounces, and then to take away four or five Ounces every two Hours after.
They pretend to extraordinary Success from this Method, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Assistance only of cooling <i>Ptisanes</i>, and such like Drinks, which they
give plentifully at the same Time. Such profuse Bleeding as this may
perhaps not suit with our Constitutions so well as with theirs; for in
common Cases they use this Practice much more freely than we: Yet we
must draw Blood with a more liberal Hand than in any other Case, if we
expect Success from it. I shall excuse myself from defining exactly how
large a Quantity of Blood is requisite to be drawn, for want of
particular Experience: but I think fit to give this Admonition, that, in
so desperate a Case as this, it is more prudent to run some hazard of
exceeding, than to let the Patient perish for want of due Evacuation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for <i>Sweating</i>, which is the other Method proposed, it ought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> no
doubt, to be continued without Intermission full twenty-four Hours, as
Dr. <i>Sydenham</i> advises. He is so particular in his Directions about it,
that I need say little. I shall only add, that <i>Theriaca</i>, and the like
solid Medicines, being offensive to the Stomach, are not the most proper
<i>Sudorifics</i>. I should rather commend an Infusion in boiling Water of
<i>Virginia Snake-Root</i>, or, in want of this, of some other warm
<i>Aromatic</i>, with the Addition of about a fourth Part of <i>Aqua
Theriacalis</i>, and a proper Quantity of Syrup of Lemons to sweeten it.
From which, in Illnesses of the same kind with the <i>Goal Fever</i>, which
approaches the nearest to the <i>Pestilence</i>, I have seen very good
Effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> either of these Methods, of <i>Bleeding</i>, or
of <i>Sweating</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> will
answer the Purpose intended by them, must be left to a larger Experience
to determine; and the Trial ought by no means to be neglected,
especially in those Cases, which promise but little Success from the
natural Course of the Disease.</p>

The beginning of this Passage, as it here stands, though it is found thus in all the Editions of <i>Thucydides</i>, is
certainly faulty, <ins class="correction" title="therapeias anapimplamenoi">&#952;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#953;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</ins> being no good
Sense. The Sentence I shall presently cite from <i>Aristotle</i> shews that
this may be rectified only by removing the Comma after <ins class="correction" title="heterou">&#7953;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#959;&#965;</ins>,
and placing it after <ins class="correction" title="therapeias">&#952;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962;</ins>,
for <ins class="correction" title="prosanapimpl&ecirc;mi">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#8055;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#953;</ins>
in <i>Aristotle</i> absolutely used signifies <i>to infect</i>. With this
Correction, the Sense of the Place will be as follows: <i>The People took
Infection by their Attendance on each other, dying like Folds of Sheep.
And this Effect of the Disease was the principal Cause of the great
Mortality: for either the Sick were left destitute, their Friends
fearing to approach them, by which means Multitudes of Families perished
without Assistance; or they infected those who relieved them, and
especially such, whom a Sense of Virtue and Honour obliged most to their Duty.</i></p>

<p>The Sense here ascribed to the word <ins class="correction" title="anapimpl&ecirc;mi">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#8055;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#956;&#953;</ins>
is confirmed yet more fully by a Passage in <i>Livy</i>, where he describes the Infection
attending a Plague or Camp Fever, which infested the Armies of the
<i>Carthaginians</i> and <i>Romans</i> at the Siege of <i>Syracuse</i>, in such words,
as shew him to have had this Passage of <i>Thucydides</i> in view; for he
says, <i>aut neglecti desertique, qui incidissent, morerentur; aut
assidentes curantesque eadem vi morbi repletos secum traherent</i>. Lib.
